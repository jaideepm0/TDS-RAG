**Important findins from the `data`**
- `topic_list` is the only useful key --> contains the `topics` and the `more_topics_url` (pointing to the next page to find topics)

**Important findings from the `data['topic_list']['topics']`**
- slug --> indicates the url directions as `/t/{slug}`
- id --> append the id `/t/{slug}/{id}`
- posts_count --> loop through the `/t/{slug}/{id}/{1..posts_count}`
- created at --> initial date of creation for the topic (between range)
- last_posted_at --> final post date in the topic (between range)

This should be good enough for us to scrape the posts content
---
 - convert the json to markdown based on content from each post (Images can be tricky)
 - orchestrate the code across range of dates
---
Finally if everything got right till now. Then we can safely embed and build the RAG
