## Deliverables
- Create a new public GitHub repository.
- Add an MIT LICENSE file.
- Write and test your code. Call `POST /run?task=...` with a few tasks and check if `GET /read?path=...` retrieves the correct files.
- Commit and push your code.
- Create a Dockerfile that builds your application.
- Publish your Docker image.
- Ensure that running your image via:

  ```bash
  podman run $IMAGE_NAME=$API_PROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000
  ```

  automatically serves the API at `http://localhost:8000/run?task=...` and `http://localhost:8000/read?path=...`.

- **Submit in this Google Form the URL of your GitHub repository**  
  (`https://github.com/user-name/repo-name`) and your Docker image name (`user-name/repo-name`).

### Note:
- Use the `AIROXY_TOKEN` environment variable. DON’T commit your AI Proxy token to your repository. Instead, set the `AIROXY_TOKEN` environment variable before running your script. Use `os.environ['AIROXY_TOKEN']` as the token in your code.
- Use your AI Proxy token. Your AI Proxy token has a $1 limit. You may run out of tokens, and you need to contact the TDS team for more.
- Stick to GPT-4-Mini. This is the only generation model that AI Proxy currently supports. When this page says “LLM,” it means GPT-4-Mini.
- Keep your prompts short and concise. Each call to `/run` and `/read` must complete within 20 seconds.
