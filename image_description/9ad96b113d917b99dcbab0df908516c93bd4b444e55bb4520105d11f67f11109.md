## Terminal Output Description

The image shows a terminal window with the following characteristics:

- **User Prompt**: The prompt displays `sarva@SURIYA MINGW64 ~/downloads`, indicating the username (`sarva`), hostname (`SURIYA`), and the current working directory (`~/downloads`).
  
- **Command Entered**: 
  ```
  $ npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md | sha256sum
  ```
  This command uses `npx` to run the Prettier formatting tool on a file named `README.md` at version `3.4.2`, piping the output to the `sha256sum` command, which calculates the SHA-256 hash of the output.

- **Output**:
  ```
  2cc8d877ded5f031c251d3319bc1b266018635156db88e63105943dbef7e106a1 *
  ```
  This line represents the SHA-256 hash calculated from the formatted `README.md` file.

- **Formatting**: The command and output are styled in different colors typical of terminal emulators, which aids in differentiating text types.
