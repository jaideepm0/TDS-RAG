# Large Language Models

This module covers the practical usage of large language models (LLMs) â€“ a relatively new area.

**LLMs incur a cost.** We have created API keys for everyone with an `iitm.ac.in` email to use `gpt-4-0-mini` and `text-embedding-3-small`. **Your usage is limited to $1 per calendar month for this course. Don't exceed that.**

## Use AI Proxy instead of OpenAI. Specifically:
1. Replace your API to `https://api.openai.com/...` with `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/...`
2. Replace the `OPENAI_API_KEY` with the `AIPROXY_TOKEN`.
