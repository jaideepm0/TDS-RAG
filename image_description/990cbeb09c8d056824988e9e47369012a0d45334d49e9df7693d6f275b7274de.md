# Image Description

The image shows a coding interface, likely a programming environment or an online coding platform. 

- **Task Description**: 
  - A prompt instructs the user to write a Python function named `most_similar(embeddings)` that calculates the cosine similarity between pairs of embeddings and returns the most similar phrases as a tuple.

- **Code Section**:
  - The user is supposed to write their Python code in a provided text box. It includes:
    ```python
    import numpy
    
    def most_similar(embeddings):
        # Your code here
        return (phrase1, phrase2)
    ```

- **Error Message**:
  - An error message appears indicating an `Incorrect answer` status, and a traceback detail reporting a `NameError` for `phrase1` not being defined.

This setting suggests a focused coding exercise aimed at producing a specific function related to cosine similarity in Python.
