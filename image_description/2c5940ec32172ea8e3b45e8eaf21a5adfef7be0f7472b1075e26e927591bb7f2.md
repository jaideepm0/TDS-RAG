# Your Task

This file, `extract-tables-from.pdf`, contains a table of student marks in Maths, Physics, English, Economics, and Biology.

### Objective
Calculate the total Biology marks of students who scored 17 or more marks in Physics in groups 43-66 (including both groups).

### Steps to Follow

1. **Data Extraction**: 
   - Retrieve the PDF containing the student marks table and use PDF parsing libraries (e.g., Tabula, Camelot, or PyPDF2) to accurately extract the table data into a workable format (e.g., CSV, Excel, or a DataFrame).

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: 
   - Convert marks to numerical data types to facilitate accurate calculations.

3. **Data Filtering**: 
   - Identify students who have scored marks between 17 and  physics in groups 43-66 (including both groups).

4. **Calculation**: 
   - Sum the marks of the filtered students to obtain the total marks for this specific cohort.
