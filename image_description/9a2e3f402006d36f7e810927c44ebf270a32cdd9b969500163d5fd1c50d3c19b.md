# Image Description

The image displays a computer screen with an active coding environment. The contents include:

- A terminal window displaying code from a Python FastAPI application.
- The code includes the following elements:
  - Import statements for FastAPI, CORS middleware, and CSV file handling.
  - Configuration lines to enable CORS allowing all origins and headers.
  - A block of code that opens a CSV file to load student data into a list named `students`.
  - A route defined with the path `@app.get("/api")`, which filters students by class based on query parameters.
  - A debugging line (`print(...)`) to show filtered student data.

On the right side, there is also a secondary terminal window indicating that the FastAPI application is running, displayed as "FastAPI" in the terminal with details about the server status.

The desktop interface shows a typical macOS layout with several folders and icons visible.
