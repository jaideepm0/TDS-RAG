## Image Description

This image appears to be a user interface element for uploading an image file. It includes the following components:

- A prompt instructing the user to upload a losslessly compressed image that is less than 1,500 bytes.
- A button labeled "Choose File" for users to select their image file.
- A text field indicating the filename "shapes_compressed.png."
- An error message displayed in red text stating: "Could not process image. Is it a browser-supported image? Image pixels do not match the original."

The background is dark, which contrasts with the text and buttons.
