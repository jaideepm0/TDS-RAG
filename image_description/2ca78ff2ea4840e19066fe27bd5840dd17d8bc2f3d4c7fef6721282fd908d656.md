## Image Description

The image displays a computer interface with a command line prompt. The main text instructs the user to download a file named `q_replace-across-files.zip`, unzip it, and replace instances of "IITM" in various case formats with "IIT Madras" in all files, while leaving the line endings unchanged. 

There is a question asking what executing the command `cat ! <hash>` in that folder will show in bash. Below this, an answer containing a hash (`63144b2ad12d5b94085c4ba4f18d57ed2e2864b1536d12ee97347`) is displayed, followed by a message indicating that the response is "Incorrect. Try again."
