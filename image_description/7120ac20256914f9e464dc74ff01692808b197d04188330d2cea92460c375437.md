## Image Description

The image displays a snippet of code or command-line output, likely from a console or terminal. Key features include:

- A JSON-like structure containing details about a function named "solver."
- The object includes various properties such as:
  - `description`: Explains the function's role in providing output for a specific command in Visual Studio Code.
  - `parameters`: Contains an indication of required inputs for the command.
  - `choices`: An array with attributes related to the function.
  - Several keys that suggest it may be part of a larger API or software interface.
  
- The bottom of the output shows a command line indication, suggesting a successful HTTP request (200 OK) to a specified endpoint.

The background is dark, typical of coding environments, with a structured layout that organizes various pieces of data systematically.
