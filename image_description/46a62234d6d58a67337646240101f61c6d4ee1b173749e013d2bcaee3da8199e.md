## Image Description

The image displays a screenshot of a programming or API documentation interface. It contains text related to retrieving data for students based on specific query parameters. Key points include:

- A description of how to structure an API URL with a query parameter (e.g., `/api/classes/1A`).
- An example that shows how different classes can be filtered by modifying the URL.
- A note about enabling CORS for GET requests.
- A suggested API URL format: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`.
- An error message at the bottom indicating that the response undefined does not match the expected format for various students.

The screen shows code snippets in a red highlighted area for emphasis, and portions of the text are formatted in a way typical of programming environments.
