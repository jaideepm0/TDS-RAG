**Instructions**

1. **Learn what you need.** Reading material is provided, but feel free to skip it if you can answer the question. (Or learn it just for pleasure.)
2. **Check answers regularly** by pressing `Check`, which shows which answers are right or wrong. You can check multiple times.
3. **Save regularly** by pressing `Save`. You can have multiple times; your last saved submission will be evaluated.
4. **Reloading is OK.** Your answers are saved in your browser (on your server). Questions won’t change except for randomized parameters.
5. **Browse any struggle.** If you are facing issues, use any resources you want. The internet, ChatGPT, friends, whatever. Use libraries or frameworks you want.
   - **It's hackable.** It's possible to get the answer to some questions by hacking the code for this quiz. That's allowed.

**Note:** You’ll run multiple servers in this exam. All of them must be running simultaneously while checking or saving answers.
