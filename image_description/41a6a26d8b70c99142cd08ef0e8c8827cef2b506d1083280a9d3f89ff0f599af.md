## Image Description

The image shows a snippet of code displayed in a code editor. The code appears to be written in Python and involves asynchronous functions, specifically formatting a file using a tool called `prettier`. The highlighted sections indicate a function definition, handling of subprocesses, and reading from a file. 

### Key Components:
- **Function Definitions**: `async def a2(email, str.file: str, **kwargs):`
- **Subprocess Handling**: Uses the `subprocess` module to run commands.
- **File Operations**: Reads and formats a file, checking for expected results.
- **Asynchronous Implementation**: `await` statements suggest the use of asynchronous programming techniques.

### Environment:
The syntax highlighting indicates a dark-themed coding environment, likely a popular code editor or IDE.
