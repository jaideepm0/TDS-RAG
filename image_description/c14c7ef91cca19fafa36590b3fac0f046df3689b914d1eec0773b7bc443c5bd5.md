### Move and Rename Files (0.5 marks)

- **Task**: 
  - Download `q-move-rename-files.zip` and extract it.
  - Use the `mv` command to move all files from folders into an empty folder.
  - Rename all files by replacing each digit with the next (e.g., `a19b.txt` becomes `a20b.txt`).

- **Question**: 
  - What does running `grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` in bash on that folder show?
