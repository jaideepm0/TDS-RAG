# Image Description

The screenshot displays a terminal or command-line interface with a series of messages related to a server setup and SQL queries. Key elements include:

- **Server Start Messages**: Instructions indicating the process of starting a server.
- **SQL Query Instructions**: Guidance on using `curl` or a web browser to send requests to a specified URL for accessing a CSV file.
- **Error Messages**: Notifications stating failure to read specific files, particularly `data/b10.csv`, with an HTTP response indicating "404 Not Found."
- **Detailed Commands**: Lines showing commands related to database and ticket sales, as well as the structure of HTTP requests.
- **Endpoints Mentioned**: References to local endpoints like `http://localhost:8001/ticket-sales.csv`.

The terminal appears to show both successful operations and encountered errors during the process.
