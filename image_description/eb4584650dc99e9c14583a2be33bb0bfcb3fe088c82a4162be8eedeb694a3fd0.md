# Error Log Overview

The image displays a Google Sheets document titled `pf1_evaluation_error_logs`. The sheet contains a list of error messages related to various tasks and modules. Each row includes timestamps and error descriptions.

## Key Observations:
- **Common Error Messages:**
  - "task module missing"
  - "application missing on 5000 port"
  - "Pascall module missing"
  - "command not found"
  - "container was bound to 127.0.0.1 instead of 0.0.0.0 which is why docker container port 8000 is not accessible outside(host os)"
  
- **Time Stamps:** 
  Errors are categorized by their occurrence, indicated in the first column with date and time formats.

## Navigation:
- The top of the sheet includes typical document controls (e.g., File, Edit, Data).
- A navigation bar at the bottom shows the current position in the document (e.g., 22,101 of 524 entries).

This log appears to be a record of issues encountered in a software or application setting.
