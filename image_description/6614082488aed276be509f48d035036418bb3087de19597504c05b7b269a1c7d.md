# Image Description

The image shows a screenshot of a web browser with several tabs open at the top. The titles of the tabs include "IIT Madras," "Graded Assignment," "TDS 2025 Jan," and "GA2 - Deploy." 

In the main browser window, there is a JSON response displayed that reads:

```json
{"marks":[65]}
```

A "Pretty-print" checkbox is visible, possibly indicating an option to format the JSON output for better readability. The background of the browser interface is standard for common web browsers.
