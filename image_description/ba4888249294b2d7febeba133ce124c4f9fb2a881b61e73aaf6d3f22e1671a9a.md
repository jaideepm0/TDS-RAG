## Image Description

The image contains a programming query along with an error message related to SQL syntax. 

### Key Elements:

1. **Question**: 
   - Asks for the total sales of items in the "Gold" ticket type using SQL.

2. **SQL Query**: 
   - `SELECT SUM(Units*Price) FROM tickets WHERE TYPE == 'Gold';`

3. **Error Message**: 
   - Displays an error: `Error: Got [42801]...`

4. **Instructions**: 
   - Additionally notes the requirement to get all rows where the `Type` is "Gold," ignores spaces, and treats mis-spellings (like "GOLD," "gold," etc.) as "Gold." Requests calculation of sales as `Units * Price` and asks to sum them up.

### Visual Style:
- The text is displayed in a code block format, indicating that it's related to programming.
- The error message highlights a syntax issue within the SQL query.
