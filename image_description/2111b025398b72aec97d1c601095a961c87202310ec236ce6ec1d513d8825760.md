## Image Description

The image displays a Python interactive shell session with several commands and outputs related to JSON manipulation. 

### Key Elements:

1. **Input Commands**:
   - `In [28]: jobj` - Variable `jobj` is referenced.
   - `In [29]: jobj = '{"name":"jivraj"}'` - Variable `jobj` is assigned a JSON string.
   - `In [31]: json.loads(jobj)` - The `json.loads()` function is called to parse the JSON string into a Python dictionary.
   - `In [32]: json.loads(jobj)['name']` - The 'name' key is accessed from the parsed dictionary.
   - `In [33]: type(jobj)` - The type of `jobj` is checked.

2. **Output Responses**:
   - Outputs display the variable's values, including the parsed dictionary and the string output for `jobj`.
   - The final output shows that the type of `jobj` is `str`.

### Visual Style:
- The text appears in a black background typical of coding interfaces, with colored syntax highlighting for better readability.
