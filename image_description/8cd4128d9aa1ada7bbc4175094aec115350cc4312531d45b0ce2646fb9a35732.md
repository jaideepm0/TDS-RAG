## Description of the Image

The image contains a user interface related to JSON data input. It features:

- A text box labeled "What is the JSON data?" where a JSON string is displayed. The JSON includes:
  - `"id": "1230422937"`
  - `"title": "Nadiya's",`
  - `"year": 2022,`
  - `"rating": 3.0`

- A red error message indicating a mismatch or an expectation issue: 
  - "Error: API calls don't match. Expected: 'Nadiyan!', 'Abat!', 'Nadiyan!'"

- Additional notes suggesting that IMDb search results may vary by region and that manual translation may be necessary.

- A button labeled "Check" at the bottom.

The overall design appears to be for a debugging or data input tool.
