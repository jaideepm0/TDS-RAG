# JSON Data Display

The image shows a JSON representation of student data in a structured format. The main elements include:

- **Students Array**: A list containing multiple objects, each representing a student.
- **Student Properties**:
  - `studentId`: A unique identifier for each student.
  - `class`: The class or group to which the student belongs.

### Example Entries:
- `{"studentId":1, "class":"10"}`
- `{"studentId":2, "class":"7K"}`
- `{"studentId":3, "class":"2G"}`

This format is commonly used for data interchange, making it easily consumable by APIs and applications for further processing or display.
