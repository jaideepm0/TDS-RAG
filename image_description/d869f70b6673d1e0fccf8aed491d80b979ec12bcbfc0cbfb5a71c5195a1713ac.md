## API Endpoint Documentation

Your application exposes an API endpoint. Letâ€™s assume that it is at `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/`.

The endpoint must accept a POST request, e.g., `POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/` with the question as well as optional file attachments as `multipart/form-data`.
