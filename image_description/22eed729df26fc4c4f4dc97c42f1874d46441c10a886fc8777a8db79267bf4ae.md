## Image Description

The image displays a code snippet and instructions related to making an HTTPS request using the Python package `httpie`. 

### Key Points:
- The command `uv run --with httpie -- https [URL]` is mentioned, which installs `httpie` and sends an HTTPS request to a specified URL.
- It instructs to send a request to `https://httpbin.org/get` with a URL-encoded email parameter set to `21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`.
- A prompt asks for the JSON output of this command, specifically requesting only the JSON body, excluding headers.

### JSON Output Example:
```json
{
    "args": {
        "email": "21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"
    },
    "headers": {
        "Accept": "*/*",
        "Accept-Encoding": "identity"
    }
}
```

### Additional Context:
- A button labeled "Check" is present, likely intended for submission or validation of the request.
