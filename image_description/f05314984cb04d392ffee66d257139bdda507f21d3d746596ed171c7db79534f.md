# TDS 2025 Jan GA5 - Data Preparation

## Instructions

1. Learn what you need. Reading materials are provided, but feel free to skip if you can answer the question. (Or learn, just for pleasure.)
2. Check answers regularly by pressing **Check** to see if those answers are right or wrong. You can check multiple times.
3. Save regularly by pressing **Save**. You can save multiple times. Your last saved submission will be evaluated.
4. Read questions carefully. Some are based on your browser and server, and questions won’t change except for randomized parameters.
5. Browse as broadly as you like, including texts, sources of security descriptions, or any other resource.
6. Use any tools you want. You can use resources you want: the Internet, ChatGPT, friends, whatever. Use any libraries or frameworks you want.
7. This is trackable. It’s possible to get the answer to some questions by hacking the code for this task. That’s allowed.
