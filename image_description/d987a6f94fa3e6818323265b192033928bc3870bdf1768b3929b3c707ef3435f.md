# Image Description

The image displays a text-based user interface, likely from a programming or cybersecurity exercise. It features a dark-themed editor that includes the following elements:

1. **Header**: 
   - The header states "SecurePrompt Technologies" and provides a brief overview of the company's focus on cybersecurity and large language models (LLMs) for enterprise applications.

2. **Content Section**:
   - The text discusses security measures and testing protocols used by SecurePrompt to ensure LLMs adhere to strict security policies.
   - A task is presented, simulating an attack vector where the user must manipulate the LLM to make it say "Yes", despite being instructed never to do so.
   - It emphasizes the importance of understanding vulnerabilities within instruction adherence for improving model security.

3. **Instructions**:
   - The user is instructed to use an "AI Proxy" token to interact with the LLM and write a prompt that would elicit a "Yes" response.
   - A cautionary note advises users to be mindful with their prompts, clarifying that successful attempts can yield different results in subsequent tries.

4. **Input Field**:
   - At the bottom, there is an input field where users are expected to type their prompt.

Overall, the image reflects a technical context focused on cybersecurity practices in relation to AI and LLM interactions.
