### Image Description

The image contains a snippet of code in a command-line interface style formatting. It instructs users to run a container image using Podman. The command is as follows:

```
podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000
```

This command sets the environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN`, mapping the local port 8000 to the container's port 8000. It mentions that this action will serve the API at the URL:

```
http://localhost:8000/run?task=...
```

The overall tone suggests it's a technical instruction intended for users familiar with containerization and API services.
