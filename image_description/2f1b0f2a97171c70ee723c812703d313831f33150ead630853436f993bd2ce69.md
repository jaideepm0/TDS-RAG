# Image Description

The image displays two sets of browser windows:

## Left Window
- **Context**: Appears to be part of a coding or online learning platform.
- **Content**: 
  - Text explaining a function or method related to document similarity.
  - An example URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`.
  - Instructions to enable CORS and mention about sending a POST request with JSON data.
  - A "Check" button at the bottom.
- **Timer**: An indication of time left, showing "02:10:25".

## Right Window
- **Context**: A REST client (perhaps Postman or similar).
- **Action**: A POST request being prepared.
- **URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`.
- **Headers**: Section to set headers.
- **JSON Body**:
  - Contains a key-value pair structure with:
    - `"contents of document"`: An array with two entries, "content of document 1" and "your very string".
- **Response Section**: 
  - Displays the response status as `200 OK`.
  - Size and time taken for the response.

The overall theme suggests working with an API related to document similarity, involving coding and testing processes.
