# Evaluation of Project 1: Docker Image Submission

**Dear Learner,**

We have evaluated your project 1 docker image submission. Please find the following files.

- **MISSING** indicates that the file is not available because the evaluation did not run or the docker image was misconfigured. If you feel this is in error, you can still contact us.

Your docker image is supposed to become responsive in 5 minutes from launch. If it does not, then we will not consider it. The image was run on an 8-core Xeon Google Cloud compute unit. So, performance of the server was not a bottleneck for your docker image. Also, each docker image had 1 Gigabit of dedicated network bandwidth available which is nearly 5 times faster than the fastest domestic internet.

### Evaluation Logs

1. **Evaluation log file:** [Link](https://example.com/evaluation-log)
   - Contains your performance report on your individual tasks.

2. **Docker log file:** [Link](https://example.com/docker-log)
   - Provides the technical performance of your container.

3. **Server start log:** (separate logs for arm v8 & x86)
   - If your docker service did not start on request, the logs will clarify our requests.

4. **Evaluation script file:** (see attachments)
   - The evaluation and grading process on this file to raise queries for these tasks.

5. **Execution plan file:** (see attachment)
   - Handles the retrieval of your docker image from Docker Hub and launching of your container instance. It also sends the required environment variables that will be used to run your container and help provide logs for communications.

6. **Solution script:** (see attachment)
   - This solves the entire project using prompt engineering only. This is a sample example of what can be achieved by leveraging the core concepts of LLMs to achieve the desired result.

### Docker Image ID
This is the ID of the docker image that was evaluated: `429984671b6b`

These scores are not final but they indicate what our current evaluation standards will score you.

If you have discovered a bug in our scripts or have a discrepancy to report with how the various scripts functions then we are happy to address your concern and where necessary make amendments to your score. 

You will have until *Tuesday* to report any problems, after which the score will be considered final. We will listen to feedback and then come up with a fair marking schema.

We will also look at the highest scores (including the score of the sample script we shared) to decide the mark on which the rest of the scores will be normalized.

We look forward to your feedback and apologize for the delay in providing you with the scores.

**Post all your concerns on this discussion thread.**
