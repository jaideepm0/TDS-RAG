### Segment 1: Google Sheets

  ```
  =SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 15, 6), 1, 10))
  ```
- **Note:** This formula will not work in Excel.
- **Prompt:** "What is the result?"

### Segment 2: Excel
- **Formula:** 
  ```
  =SUM(TAKE(SORTBY({3,14,16,10,3,12,15,4,11,11,14,14}, {10,9,13,2,11,8,16,14,7,15,5,4,6,1,3,12}), 1, 9))
  ```
