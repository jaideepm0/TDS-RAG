Dear Learner,

Please do not ignore this important announcement. We are still doing some checks on the server endpoints for your TDS Project 2.

If you have turned it off because you were told that evaluations were complete, **please turn them back on.**

We apologise for the inconvenience caused. We aim to complete the evaluations as soon as possible and are cognizant that some of you are using up credits on Azure and other platforms to keep them up and running.

We will inform you in subsequent emails when your evaluation is complete so that you do not have to keep them up and running longer than necessary.

Kind regards,  
TDS Team
