# Image Description

The image is a meme featuring a photograph of a partially constructed stadium. The building appears to have sections that are incomplete or poorly aligned, emphasizing a lack of proper finishing. 

**Text Overlay:** 
- At the top, it reads: "WHEN YOU CANNOT REFACTOR THE CODE"
- At the bottom, it states: "BECAUSE OF A TIGHT DEADLINE"

The imagery and text suggest a humorous commentary on the challenges faced in software development, particularly the need to deliver results quickly without the opportunity for thorough code improvement.
