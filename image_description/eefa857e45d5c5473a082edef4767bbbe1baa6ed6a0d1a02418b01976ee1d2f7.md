## Image Description

The image displays a code snippet written in Python. It begins with importing the `json` library and defining a response variable named `my_response` which contains a JSON string. The string includes the following components:

1. **Function Definition**: A function called `analyze_sentiment()` is defined.
2. **API URL**: The URL points to OpenAI's API for chat completions.
3. **Headers**: Includes authorization using a bearer token and content type as application/json.
4. **Data Initialization**: A data dictionary is created with model specifications and message content asking to analyze sentiment (GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL).
5. **API Call**: Makes a POST request to the API using `httpx` library.
6. **Response Handling**: The response is processed to return the result in JSON format.
7. **Main Block**: There is a conditional block for executing the `analyze_sentiment()` function and handling exceptions.

The code is structured with varying levels of indentation typical in Python, and the text is shown in a code editor-like interface with syntax highlighting.
