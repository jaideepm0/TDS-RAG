# Image Description

The image displays the interface of a code editor, specifically Visual Studio Code. 

## Key Elements:

- **File Explorer Panel**: 
  - Located on the left side, it shows a directory named "Imagент."
  - Contains files: `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `Dockerfile`, `evaluate.py`, `LICENSE`, `readme.md`, `tasksA.py`, and `tasksB.py`.

- **Main Window**:
  - At the top, there is a 'Start' section with options such as "New File," "Open File," "Open Folder," "Clone Git Repository," and "Connect to...".
  - Below this, in the "Recent" section, a project labeled "Ilmagент..." is displayed. 

- **Terminal Output**:
  - The terminal shows a command for cloning a Git repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/23f2001390/Ilmagент.git
    ```
  - The output includes steps of the cloning process: enumerating, counting, compressing objects, resolving deltas, and indicating successful completion with data sizes.

- **Overall Color Scheme**:
  - The interface uses a dark theme characteristic of many modern code editors, enhancing readability against the light text.
