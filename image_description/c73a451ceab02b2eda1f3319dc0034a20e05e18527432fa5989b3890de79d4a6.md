## Image Description

The image shows a snippet of JSON data displayed in a web browser. The data appears to represent a list of students with attributes such as `studentId` and `class`. 

### Key Details:
- The JSON data is structured as an array of objects.
- Each object contains:
  - `studentId`: A unique identifier for each student.
  - `class`: Indicates the class the student belongs to (e.g., "SN" or "IP").
- The line "Pretty-print" is visible at the top, suggesting the data is formatted for readability.

### Example Entries:
- `{"studentId":57, "class":"SN"}`
- `{"studentId":67, "class":"IT"}`
- `{"studentId":117, "class":"IP"}`

This format presents a clear view of the student records.
