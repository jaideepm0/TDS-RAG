# Code Snippet and Terminal Output

## Code
The image shows a code editor, specifically Visual Studio Code, displaying a Python script. The relevant sections of the code are:
```python
import os
import subprocess

# Print the computed paths of the data folder
print(os.path.abspath(data))

# Running the Python script with the provided argument
script_url = "https://example.com/path/to/script.py"
response = subprocess.run(['curl', script_url], check=True)

# Execute the output script
subprocess.run(['curl', 'data/tagging.py', 'email.py'], check=True)
```

## Terminal Output
At the bottom of the image, the terminal output provides the following information on executing the script:
- It starts with a warning about a script changing post-evaluation.
- Processes some commands successfully while showing the progress of the request with:
  - Data sent and received
  - Total bytes transferred: 1,110, verified: 0, 
  - And a completion message indicating successful execution.
