# Step Analysis Report

## Introduction
This analysis examines the number of steps walked each day over a week and compares the results over time. Data was collected using a fitness tracker and recorded daily. The following steps were taken:
1. Compared daily steps with previous weeks.
2. Data was logged into a spreadsheet.

| Steps Walked |      |      |      |      |      |
|---------------|------|------|------|------|------|
|               | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday | Sunday |
| Steps        | 8,500 | 10,000 | 9,600 |       |       |       |

## Code for Step Analysis
To analyze the step data, we used Python:

```python
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df.describe())
```

## Observations
- The highest step count was recorded on **Sunday**.
- There was a general comparison with friends:
  - Alice: **10,500** steps/day average
  - Bob: **9,800** steps/day average
- "Walking together keeps us motivated!" - A friend from the study group.

## Improvements
Some ways to improve step count tracking:
- Track steps using an advanced fitness tracker.
