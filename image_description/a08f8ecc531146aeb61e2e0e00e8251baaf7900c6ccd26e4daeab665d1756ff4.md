# Terminal Output

The image displays a terminal interface with the following elements:

1. **Session Header**:
   - Labels the project as "Nelson TDS-Project-1-LLM".
   - An export command for the environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN`.

2. **cURL Command**:
   - A cURL command is executed to send a POST request to an API endpoint:
     ```
     curl -X POST http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"model": "text-embedding-3-small", "input": ["king", "queen"]}'
     ```

3. **Progress Output**:
   - Displays progress metrics including % Total, % Received, and Average Speed.
   - Indicates that the total time for the request is approximately 3 seconds.

4. **Response Data**:
   - The JSON response contains:
     - `"object": "list"`
     - `data` array with an object that includes:
       - `"object": "embedding"`
       - `"index": 0`
       - An array named `"embedding"`, which includes a series of numerical values.

5. **Numerical Data**:
   - A list of floating point numbers within the embedding array.

This output appears to be part of a process for obtaining embeddings for the terms "king" and "queen" using a specified model.
