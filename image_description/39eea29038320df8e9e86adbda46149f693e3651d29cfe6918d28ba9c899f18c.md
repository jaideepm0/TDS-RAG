## Image Description

The image displays a dark-themed interface, likely a code editor or a development environment. At the top, there is a message advising the user to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow GET requests from any origin. Below it, there is a prompt asking for the API URL endpoint for FastAPI, with an example provided: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`. 

A text input field is shown, where the user is expected to enter a URL. The entered value is `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`, which appears to be highlighted in red, indicating an error or issue. Below this, an error message states "TypeError: Load failed," suggesting a failure to load the API URL.

Overall, the interface is designed for developers to interact with APIs, with an emphasis on ensuring proper configurations for successful connectivity.
