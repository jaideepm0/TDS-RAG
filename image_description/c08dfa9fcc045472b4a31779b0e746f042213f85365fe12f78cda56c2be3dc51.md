# Inbound Port Rules

This section describes the settings for inbound port rules for a virtual machine.

## Options for Public Inbound Ports:
- **None**: No public inbound ports are accessible.
- **Allow selected ports**: Specific ports can be selected for access.

## Selected Inbound Ports:
- **SSH (22)**: This port is selected for SSH access.

> **Warning**: Allowing all IP addresses to access your virtual machine is only recommended for testing purposes. It is advisable to use the Advanced controls in the Networking tab to create rules that limit inbound traffic to known IP addresses.
