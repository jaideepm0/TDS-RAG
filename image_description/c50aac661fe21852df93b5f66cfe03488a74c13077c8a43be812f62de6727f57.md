# Image Description

The image displays a webpage from Docker Hub, specifically showing a "404 - Oops!" error message. The background is dark, and there is a large blue circle in the center of the page. Inside the circle, it states "404" followed by "Oops! The page you have requested was not found." Below the text, there is an illustration of a computer with a smiling face. The top of the webpage features a navigation bar with options such as "Explore," and there is another button for "Sign in" and "Sign up." The overall design is clean and modern.
