# Image Description

The image shows a web development environment, specifically a console or debugging interface in a browser. Here are the key elements:

1. **Task List:** 
   - The first section consists of a numbered list that outlines tasks related to API development:
     1. API Development: Use a web framework to develop an API that takes a country query parameter.
     2. Extracting Wikipedia Content: Instructions for finding and parsing the Wikipedia page of a specified country.
     3. Extracting Headings: Guidance on extracting headings from the fetched content using an HTML parsing library.
     4. Generating Markdown Outline: Directions for formatting the extracted headings.
     5. Enabling CORS: Instructions to configure the web application for CORS support.

2. **API Endpoint Query:**
   - A text field is present for entering the API endpoint URL, with an example URL `http://localhost:8000/api/outline`.

3. **Error Messages:**
   - Below the task list, there are multiple error messages displayed in red text. These messages indicate issues related to loading resources:
     - A message shows a `TypeError` stating "Load failed," and various fetch attempts to the URL `http://localhost:8000/...` are blocked due to access control checks.
     - The specific mention of access being denied for `http://localhost:8000/.../?country=TheBahamas` suggests a CORS policy issue.

4. **Browser Elements:**
   - The interface appears to be Chrome Developer Tools, with sections for "Elements," "Console," "Sources," "Network," and more visible at the top. This indicates that the user is debugging a web application.

Overall, the image captures a moment of troubleshooting in web development, specifically dealing with API calls and CORS policies.
