# Docker Build Log

This image displays a terminal output from a Docker build process. Key points include:

- **SHA Digest Tracking**: Various SHA256 hashes are shown for layers being extracted and exported.
- **Directory Operations**:
  - `WORKDIR /app`: Sets the working directory to `/app`.
  - `COPY .. /app`: Copies files into the container.
  - `COPY requirements.txt /app`: Copies the requirements.txt file.
  - `RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`: Installs Python dependencies listed in the requirements file without using cache.
- **Exporting Layers**: Each layer is being exported with corresponding SHA256 digests.
- **Application Startup**:
  - Indicates the application is starting, with a URL output for Uvicorn running at `http://0.0.0.0:8000`.
- **Server Process Information**: Additional logging shows the status of the server process and the command used to run the Docker container.

### Note
- The output suggests a successful build and potential application launch within a Docker container environment.
