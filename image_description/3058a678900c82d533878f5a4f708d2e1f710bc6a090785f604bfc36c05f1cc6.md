# Code Description

The image contains Python code that calculates distances between various communities and a central command post using the Haversine formula.

## Code Breakdown

1. **Importing the Library**:
   ```python
   from haversine import haversine
   ```

2. **Defining Coordinates**:
   Coordinates for four communities and a central command post are defined:
   - `OakParkTown`: (27.0096, -72.3822)
   - `EastSpringsSettlement`: (27.0769, -72.394)
   - `EastFieldsJunction`: (27.0961, -72.4248)
   - `RedPointTown`: (26.9874, -72.426)
   - `CentralCommandPostLocation`: (27.0552, -72.4893)

3. **Calculating Distances**:
   A dictionary is created to store the distances between each community and the central command post:
   ```python
   distances = {
       "OakParkTown": haversine(OakParkTown, CentralCommandPostLocation),
       "EastSpringsSettlement": haversine(EastSpringsSettlement, CentralCommandPostLocation),
       "EastFieldsJunction": haversine(EastFieldsJunction, CentralCommandPostLocation),
       "RedPointTown": haversine(RedPointTown, CentralCommandPostLocation)
   }
   ```

4. **Sorting Communities**:
   The communities are sorted based on their distances:
   ```python
   optimal_sequence = sorted(distances, key=distances.get)
   ```

5. **Printing the Evacuation Sequence**:
   The optimal evacuation sequence along with distances is printed:
   ```python
   for i, community in enumerate(optimal_sequence, start=1):
       print(f"{i}. {community} - Distance: {distances[community]:.2f} km")
   ```

## Output Sample

1. EastFieldsJunction - Distance: 7.84 km
2. EastSpringsSettlement - Distance: 9.74 km
3. RedPointTown - Distance: 9.81 km
4. OakParkTown - Distance: 11.76 km
