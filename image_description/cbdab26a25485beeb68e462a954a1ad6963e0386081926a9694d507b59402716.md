### Code Description

The image displays a snippet of Python code that performs the following functions:

1. **Line 35**: A comment explaining that all files are accessed from the 'data' folder within the project root.
   
2. **Line 36**: Defines `PROJECT_ROOT`, which stores the absolute path to the current working directory using `os.path.abspath()` and `os.getcwd()`.

3. **Line 37**: Defines `DATA_DIR`, which joins the `PROJECT_ROOT` with the string "data" to create a path for the 'data' directory.

4. **Line 38**: A blank line for readability.

5. **Line 40**: A comment noting that the `data` directory should be ensured to exist, followed by a command that uses `os.makedirs()` to create the `DATA_DIR`, allowing for its existence to not raise an error if it already exists (due to `exist_ok=True`).
