## Python Code Example

The image displays a block of Python code written for processing product embeddings. Key features include:

1. A loop iterating through items in a list called `words`.
2. Calculation of the dot product between `embeddings[i]` and another `embeddings[i]` for each word.
3. The result is appended to a list named `dot_product.df`.
4. The function returns the maximum value of `dot_product.df`.
5. An example print statement outputs a formatted message that begins with, "experienced issues during checkout."
6. A list of numerical values follows, likely representing similarity scores or embeddings.

### Error Message
- At the bottom, there is a TypeError indicating `Z.runPython('_list')` is not a function.
