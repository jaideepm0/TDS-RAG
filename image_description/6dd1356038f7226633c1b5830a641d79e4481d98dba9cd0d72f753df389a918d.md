# Email Evaluation Notice

## Body
Dear Learner,

We have evaluated your project 1 docker image submission. Please find the following files.  
**MISSING** indicates that the file is not available because the evaluation did not run or the docker image was misconfigured. If you feel this is in error, you can still contest.

Your score will result in a score of 0.

Your docker image is supposed to become responsive in 5 minutes from launch. If it does not, then you will not be evaluated. The images were set to run on an x86 environment to check the performance of your docker image. Also, such performance has a bottleneck if you didn't use dedicated resources available which is nearly 5 times faster than the fastest emulation.

### Action Items:
1. **Evaluation log file:** MISSING. This contains your performance report for your individual tasks.
   - Docker file: [Link to Docker file](http://drive.google.com)
   - Repository: [Link to repository](https://www.yourrepositorylink.com)

2. **Server start log file:** (separate logs for arm vs x86)  
   Ensure that you have provided the correct file to start container.

3. **Database connection file:** (separate logs for arm vs x86)  
   This must allow for proper communication with your database.

4. **Data file:** (attach this file to the data directory)  
   This file handles the retrieval of your docker image from the server.

Best regards,

[Evaluation Team]
