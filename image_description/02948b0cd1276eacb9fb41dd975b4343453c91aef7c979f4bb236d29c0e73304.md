# Image Description

The image displays a screenshot of a coding environment, specifically Visual Studio Code (VS Code). 

## Layout
- The left panel shows the **Explorer** with several files and directories listed, including:
  - `.env`
  - `app.py`
  - `datagen.py`
  - `Dockerfile`
  - `README.md`
  - `task.py`
  - `tasks.py`
  - `evaluate.py`

## Code Snippet
The right panel contains the contents of the `evaluate.py` file, which appears to be a Python script. Key features include:
- A comment block indicating script requirements (`requires-python ">=3.13"`) and dependencies.
- Multiple import statements:
  - Importing standard libraries such as `sys`, `hashlib`, `http`, `json`, and `logging`.
  - Importing `numpy` as `np`.
  - Importing functions from `datetime` and `lxml.html`.
- A function `get_markdown()` with several defined helper functions: 
  - `get_dates()`
  - `get_contacts()`
  - `get_logs()`
  - `get_docs()`
  - `get_email()`
  - `get_credit_card()`
  - `get_tickets()`

The file is highlighted with syntax coloring typical for JavaScript and Python coding environments, making elements like keywords, strings, and functions visually distinctive.
