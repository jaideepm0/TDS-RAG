Dear Learner,

We have evaluated your project 1 docker image submission. Please find the following files:

1. **Evaluation log file:** [evaluation log link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uHkYQ61sud2z_bklmkmF7bMLzsyw2tps/view)  
   This contains your performance report for your individual tasks.

2. **Docker log file:** [docker log link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SRWg531R0N6O0sY4Xk47_LoMTyiv/view)  
   This provides the technical performance of your container.

3. **Server start log file:** (See attachment)  
   Your docker service did not start or respond as expected.

4. **Evaluation script file:** (See attachment)  
   This file has the actual tests that were run against your submission and the scoring mechanism.

5. **Data generation file:** (See attachment)  
   The evaluation file depends on this file to create the data for the tasks.

6. **Docker orchestration file:** (See attachment)  
   This handles the retrieval of your docker image for docker hub and binding of your container instances. It also sends the environmental variables that will be required for your container to function and the port mappings for communications.

7. **Solution script:** (See attachment)  
   This resolves the entire project 1 using prompt engineering only. This is a sample example of what can be achieved by leveraging the core concepts of LLMs to achieve the desired result.

These scores are not final but they indicate what our current evaluation standards will score you.

If you have discovered a bug in our scripts or have a discrepancy to report with how the various scripts functions then we are happy to address your concern and where necessary make amendments to your score.

We will allow next Tuesday to report any problems. After which the score will be considered final. We will listen to feedback and then come up with a final marking schema.
