# Weather Data Integration for AgroTech Insights

**Overview:**
AgroTech Insights is a leading agricultural technology company that provides data-driven solutions for farmers and agribusinesses. They leverage advanced analytics and real-time data to optimize crop yields, manage resources efficiently, and mitigate risks associated with adverse weather conditions.

**Your Task:**
You are tasked with developing a system that accomplishes the following:

1. **API Integration and Data Retrieval:** 
   - Use the BBC Weather API to fetch the weather forecast for **Manila**. Send a GET request to the locale's endpoint to obtain the city's weather data.

2. **Weather Data Extraction:** 
   - Retrieve the weather forecast using the obtained locale ID. Send a GET request to the weather broker API endpoint with the locale ID.

3. **Data Transformation:** 
   - Enhance the output by including `issue` and `enhancedWeatherDescription` from each dayâ€™s forecast. Retrieve through the forecast's array in the API response and map each `issue` to its corresponding `enhancedWeatherDescription`. Create a JSON object where each key is the `issue` and the value is the `enhancedWeatherDescription`.

**Expected Output:**

The output would look like this:

```json
{
  "2025-01-01": "Sunny with scattered clouds",
  "2025-01-02": "Partly cloudy with a chance of rain",
  "2025-01-03": "Additional clouds"
}
```

**Next Steps:**
Examine the JSON weather forecast description for **Manila**:

```json
{
  "2025-01-01": "Sunny and a gentle breeze",
  "2025-01-02": "Sunny and a gentle breeze",
  "2025-01-03": "Sunny and a gentle breeze",
  "2025-01-04": "Sunny and a gentle breeze"
}
```
