The ROEs are not GAs with short deadlines. A GA question usually tests one concept in isolation. ROEs typically require you to combine multiple concepts and use multiple tools in order to answer the question. (in a very short time).

If your goal is totally rely on the LLM to solve it for you… past experience shows us that ROEs complexity is usually difficult for an LLM to overcome without significant assistance from the “hooomann” 

So practise with the concepts are going to be key without having to look up everything because looking up everything takes too much time. Collaboration with others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet. There is a reason for that. Its very hard.

There will be a dataset or multiple datasets. Sometimes you may have to combine datasets to answer questions. You will have to extract data from the dataset. You will have to transform/clean the data and you will have to gain some information from the data, is what typical ROEs test.
