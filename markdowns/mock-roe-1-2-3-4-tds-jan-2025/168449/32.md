Q2: Download and unzip q-least-unique-subjects-from-csv.zip. It has 2 files:

1. `students.csv` has 2 columns:
2. studentId: A unique identifier for each student
3. class: The class (including section) of the student
4. `subjects.csv` has 2 columns:
5. studentId: The identifier for each student
6. subject: The name of the subject they have chosen

What are the least number of subjects any class has taken up? List the 3 lowest count of subjects in order.

```
!unzip /content/q-least-unique-subjects-from-csv.zip -d /content/extracted_folder
import pandas as pd
df1 = pd.read_csv("/content/extracted_folder/students.csv")
df2 = pd.read_csv("/content/extracted_folder/subjects.csv")
merged_df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on="studentId")
class_subject_counts = merged_df.groupby("class")["subject"].nunique()
lowest_subject_counts = class_subject_counts.nsmallest(3)
print(lowest_subject_counts)

```
