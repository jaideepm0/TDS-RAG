### Update 3

Dear Learner

Please access the Mock ROE 2 at this link:


[exam.sanand.workers.dev](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2024-sep-roe1)

### [Technical Assessment](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2024-sep-roe1)

There is no time limit for this Mock. The expected time to solve this ROE is 45 mins. Set an alarm and try it.  
After the session at 9pm there will be a session where we will show you the solutions step by step (not like the previous session which was a demo of ROE).  
To check your answers you will need to run the following script in the console.

```
inputs = document.querySelectorAll('input')
textboxes = document.querySelectorAll("textarea")
buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button")
inputs.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
buttons.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
textboxes.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));

```

Do not submit or save your answers.

All the best!  
Kind regards  
TDS Team

### Update 2

#### 26/02/2025 11:00 am

We will be releasing Mock 2 tonight on an exam portal at 8pm (no time limit).  
The link for the Mock 2 will be available in this post as well as in the Seek Portal. An email will also be sent with the link to Mock 2.

We will be conducting a solving session at 9pm. This will be a regular teaching session (not like the first session on Tuesday 25/02/25 which was a real preview of what ROE looks like).

Kind regards,  
TDS Team
