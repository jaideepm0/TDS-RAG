## Image Description

The image displays a command line interface (CLI) showing the output of a terminal session. Here are the key elements:

- **Prompt**: The command prompt indicates the user is logged in as `vikramjnicasr` on a system with the path `/mnt/c/IIIT_Madras/TDS_Project_15`.
- **Command Executed**: 
  - `sudo ls /`: This command is run with superuser privileges to list the contents of the root directory (`/`).
- **Output**: The response of the command includes a list of directories and files located in the root directory:
  - Directories mentioned include:
    - `bin`
    - `boot`
    - `etc`
    - `lib`
    - `lib64`
    - `mnt`
    - `proc`
    - `run`
    - `srv`
    - `sys`
    - `tmp`
    - `usr`
    - `var`
    - Other elements like `lost+found` and `media`.
- **Visual Styling**: The text is presented in a monospaced font typical of terminal interfaces, indicating a structured layout.

Overall, the image captures a typical interaction within a UNIX-like operating system's terminal environment.
