GA 4 Q2

My JSON matches the titles of the movies as in the website, but in portal it is showing error and expecting something different from what is given in the website. How to handle this ?

# Movie Information

- **Title:** Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey
- **Release Year:** 2023
- **Duration:** 1 hour 24 minutes
- **Rating:** Not Rated
- **User Rating:** 2.9 (based on 33,000 ratings)
- **Metascore:** 16

# Image Description

The image displays an error message related to JSON data parsing. The layout includes the following elements:

- **Header Text**: "What is the JSON data?"
  
- **JSON Snippet**: 
  ```json
  {
    "title": "25. Battlefield Earth",
    "year": "2000",
    "rating": "2.5"
  }
  ```

- **Error Message**: 
  - Contains a primary error line: "Error: At [1]: title: Values don't match."
  - **Expected Value**: Highlighted in red: `2. Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey.`
  - **Actual Value**: Highlighted in green: `"2. Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey."`

The error suggests a mismatch between the expected and actual data in the JSON structure.
```

contradiction :  
" 2. Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey" (in web page) & ( delivered by the JSON)  
" 2. Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey" (expected in portal ) & ( raising error statement )
