What you meant by " Ensure the first item is schedule triggered confirmation"? You meant the latest one should be this right?

# Image Description

The image shows a user interface from GitHub's Actions section. It displays the following key elements:

- **Header**: The top section has the repository name "DigiprynChudusamafTM" and a navigation menu including options like Code, Pull Requests, Actions, Projects, Wiki, Security, Insights, and Settings.
  
- **Main Area**: 
  - A title reads "All workflows," indicating that it is showing all workflows related to the repository.
  - There is a message box suggesting users can provide feedback to improve GitHub Actions.
  
- **Workflow Runs**: 
  - A list titled "15 workflow runs" shows various instances of a workflow named "Daily Commit." 
  - Each entry displays details such as:
    - Status indicators (e.g., green for success, yellow for in progress).
    - The event type ("Manual" or "Scheduled").
    - Time since the run (e.g., "8 minutes ago," "4 hours ago").
    - Branch and actor information corresponding to each run.

The overall layout is dark-themed, typical of GitHub's user interface.
