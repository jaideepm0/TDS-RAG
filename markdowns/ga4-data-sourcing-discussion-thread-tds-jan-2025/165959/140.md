[@21F1005510](/u/21f1005510) Actually, some IMDb titles have multiple names. For example, [The Recruit](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16030542/) is [also known as Graymail in India](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16030542/releaseinfo/?ref_=tt_dt_aka#akas). My server checks from a different region from yours. Hence the need for manual corrections for a few titles.

**Why didn’t I pick an exercise that could be fully automated?** Because this is how real-life data sourcing is. It’s never perfect. You often need to create workflows where you’re able to quickly correct such errors in automation.
