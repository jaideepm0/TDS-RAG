In ques 4 Scrap the BBC Weather API,  
I scraped the locationId for my city (i.e Mumbai)

and post that also mapped each `issueDate` to its corresponding `enhancedWeatherDescription` .

The sample output mentioned was:  
The output would look like this:

```
{
  "2025-01-01": "Sunny with scattered clouds",
  "2025-01-02": "Partly cloudy with a chance of rain",
  "2025-01-03": "Overcast skies",
  // ... additional days
}

```

And My Output after scraping (And as explained by professor in Video 2 BBC weather was)

{  
“2025-02-05”: “A clear sky and light winds”,  
“2025-02-06”: “A clear sky and light winds”,  
“2025-02-07”: “A clear sky and light winds”,  
“2025-02-08”: “A clear sky and light winds”,  
“2025-02-09”: “A clear sky and light winds”,  
“2025-02-10”: “A clear sky and light winds”,  
“2025-02-11”: “A clear sky and light winds”,  
“2025-02-12”: “A clear sky and light winds”,  
“2025-02-13”: “A clear sky and light winds”,  
“2025-02-14”: “A clear sky and light winds”,  
“2025-02-15”: “A clear sky and light winds”,  
“2025-02-16”: “A clear sky and light winds”,  
“2025-02-17”: “A clear sky and light winds”,  
“2025-02-18”: “A clear sky and light winds”,  
“2025-02-19”: “A clear sky and light winds”  
}

But it’s giving Error::  
Error: At root: Different number of properties

Can you please help how to fix this issue.
