## Image Description

The image displays a JSON data structure with two objects related to titles and their corresponding details.

1. **First Object:**
   - **Title:** "I. The Night Agent"
   - **Year:** "2023-"
   - **Rating:** "7.5"

2. **Second Object:**
   - An error message indicating a mismatch in expected values:
     - **Error:** "Values don't match."
     - **Expected:** "9"
     - **Actual:** "9. You're Cordially Invited"

The background of the image appears dark, emphasizing the text and the structure of the JSON data.

Are we expecting the result to match exactly as per the benchmark of qa4.
