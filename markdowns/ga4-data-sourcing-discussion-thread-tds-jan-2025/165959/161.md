[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir,  
I don’t understand this error. In the website, the movie name doesn’t have a colon “:”, but in the result it is expecting so.

```markdown
## Image Description

This image appears to be a snippet of JSON data related to a movie titled "11. Kraven the Hunter." The details provided include:

- **ID**: tt8790086
- **Title**: 11. Kraven the Hunter
- **Year**: 2024
- **Rating**: 5.4

Additionally, there is an error message indicating a mismatch in expected and actual titles, specifying that the expected title is "11. Kraven: The Hunter" while the actual title listed is "11. Kraven the Hunter."
