This is the only thing which worked for me.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir, can I suggest to replace the snapshot of example output which expects the year to be an integer and the ratings as to be floats (instead of actual evaluation which expects them to be strings). Also, it would help to clarify that “Movie 1” should carry the numerical prefix as reported in IMDB. The current example on the portal is:  

```markdown
The image displays a snippet of JSON-like data structure, formatted with syntax highlighting. It includes an array containing two objects that represent movies. Each object has the following properties:

- **id**: A string representing the unique identifier for each movie.
- **title**: The title of the movie.
- **year**: The year the movie was released.
- **rating**: The rating of the movie (presumably on a 10-point scale).

### Example Entries:
1. **Movie 1**
   - ID: `tt1234567`
   - Year: 2021
   - Rating: 5.8

2. **Movie 2**
   - ID: `tt7654321`
   - Year: 2019
   - Rating: 6.2

Additionally, there is a comment indicating that there are more titles that could be included in this array.
