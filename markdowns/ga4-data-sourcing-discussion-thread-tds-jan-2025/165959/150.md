> In Graded Assignment - 4 >> Q2, the year I extracted appears as “2024,” whereas the expected value on the portal is “2024–”. I have manually adjusted several values based on the expected format. This issue is specific to the year field.

I guess for the year part, there are certain series having multiple seasons, for which hyphenated “years” are given.

For the particular instance - `“2024–”`, it appears another season/part is announced, thats why it is written that way.
