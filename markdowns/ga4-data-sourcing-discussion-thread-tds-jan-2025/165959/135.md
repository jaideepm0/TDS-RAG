Hello Sir, thank you for changing the question.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Iâ€™m getting the below error:

```
Words like https, webbed, impact are missing (or not separated as words). 

```

However, in the source PDF file itself these words are not available.

# Image Description

The image displays a table on a dark background containing rows and columns of Latin words. The words included are:

- **Row 1**: quos, utrum, tredecim, valetud, cras
- **Row 2**: videlicet, laudantium, aetas, canis, tantum

Beneath the table, there is an error message in red text stating: 

> "Error: Words like https, webbed, impact are missing (or not separated as words)."
