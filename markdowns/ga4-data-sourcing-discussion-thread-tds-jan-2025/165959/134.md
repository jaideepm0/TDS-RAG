In Q2. getting , able to fix most of the errors but  

# Image Description

The image displays a computer screen with a web browser window open. The browser features:

- A navigation bar at the top with multiple open tabs, including titles such as "MVD ratings & 40 X X" and "Flight Risk."
- A detailed view of various movies or shows, with titles, descriptions, and ratings listed on the left side. The movies listed include "Back in Action," "Flight Risk," and "The Recruit."
- The right side of the screen shows a console with JSON data or similar structured information, which seems to pertain to the titles displayed on the left.

At the bottom of the screen, the user's desktop displays icons, indicating a macOS interface, with a nature-themed wallpaper visible in the background.

Error: At [18].title: Values don’t match. Expected: “19. Graymail”. Actual: “19. The Recruit”

this kind of errors for some titles, even though i only applied Rating filter and nothing else, then why i’m getting different titles then the test cases?
