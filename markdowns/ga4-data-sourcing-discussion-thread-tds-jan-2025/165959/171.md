### Image Description

The image features a code snippet presented in a dark-themed interface. 

- The top section contains a question: "What is the JSON data?"
- Below that, there is a JSON-like structure with the following fields:
  - `"id": "tt10087772"`
  - `"title": "9. Flight Risk"`
  - `"year": "2025"` 
- An error message appears at the bottom, stating: 
  ```
  Error: At [0] year: Values don't match. Expected: "2025" - Actual: "2025"
  ```
- The background is dark, and the text is in a light color, typical of a code editor or a programming environment.
```
