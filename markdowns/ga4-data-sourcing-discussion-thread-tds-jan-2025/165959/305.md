Alright so in Q4 of W4, We have to extract weather forecast data from bbc servers for a given city. The city I have been given Nur-Sultan is not present in the bbc data base, it appears the city is now known as Astana and is listed in the bbc database as Astana.  
Since Nur-Sultan doesn’t exist in the bbc database, all of my attempts to extract data for it were meet with failure. So I extracted the data for Astana and pasted it in the portal but that doesn’t work as well and throws the following error “TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading ‘id’)”  
What am I suppose to do? [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  

# Image Description

The image contains a computer screen displaying a coding interface or programming environment. It features the following elements:

1. **Task Overview**:
   - A numbered list outlining steps for retrieving weather data using the BBC Weather API for a location called "nur-sultan."
   - Steps include API integration, data retrieval, and transformation into JSON format.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   - Example code output showing a weather forecast in a JSON-like structure for specific dates. Each forecast includes descriptions of weather conditions, such as “sunny with scattered clouds” and “partly cloudy with a chance of rain.”

3. **Additional Information**:
   - A prompt related to creating a JSON object to represent the weather forecasts.
   - A text box containing forecast descriptions for various dates, including terms like “partly cloudy and a moderate breeze” and “light snow and a fresh breeze.”

4. **User Interaction Element**:
   - A timer indicating "06:00:20 left" suggesting a time-limited task.
   - Buttons at the top for checking answers, saving, and checking all.

The overall layout resembles a coding assignment or an interactive programming task, focusing on utilizing an API for real-time data retrieval.

Below is the data for Astana that I was able to extract, Since Nur-Sultan doesn’t exist in the bbc database:  
{  
“2025-02-09”: “Partly cloudy and a moderate breeze”,  
“2025-02-10”: “Sunny intervals and a moderate breeze”,  
“2025-02-11”: “Sunny and a gentle breeze”,  
“2025-02-12”: “Light snow and a fresh breeze”,  
“2025-02-13”: “Light snow and a fresh breeze”,  
“2025-02-14”: “Light snow and a gentle breeze”,  
“2025-02-15”: “Light snow and a gentle breeze”,  
“2025-02-16”: “Light snow and a gentle breeze”,  
“2025-02-17”: “Light cloud and a gentle breeze”,  
“2025-02-18”: “Sunny intervals and a gentle breeze”,  
“2025-02-19”: “Light cloud and a gentle breeze”,  
“2025-02-20”: “Light cloud and a gentle breeze”,  
“2025-02-21”: “Sunny and a moderate breeze”,  
“2025-02-22”: “Light snow and a moderate breeze”
