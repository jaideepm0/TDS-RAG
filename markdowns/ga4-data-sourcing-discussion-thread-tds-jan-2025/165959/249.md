first convert it roughly to md file then use ai and tell it to add (all the errors one by one). and slowly it will solve all the errors

yes i know it is not the correct way to convert pdf to md file but its just a way to trick the checking system.

but i have an issue it gave me error that it does not contains the word “bash, javascript, whole redesign, net, suasoria” which is not in the actual pdf, but i added it and it worked. it was just pure trial and error.
