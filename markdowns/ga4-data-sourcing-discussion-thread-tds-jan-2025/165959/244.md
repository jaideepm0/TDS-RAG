## Image Description

The image displays a user interface for entering a GitHub repository URL. 

- **Input Field**: There is a text box labeled "Enter your repository URL (format: https://github.com/USER/REPO)" where the URL `https://github.com/AyranTikam/AyranTikam` is entered.
- **Error Message**: Below the input field, an error message indicates that the latest run does not include `23f2002116d6ds.study.jtim.ac.in` in the name of the specified URL.

The overall background of the interface is a dark color.
```

  
Can’t seem to get this working, have tried many variations by now like including my email in each of the name sections in every possible permutation. Probably just some silly mistake I haven’t noticed yet but any help would be appreciated. On Linux Mint if that’s relevant.

main.yml:

```
name: Daily Commit Workflow

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '10 17 * * *' 
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  commit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Add commit using 23f2001216@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
        env:
          PAT: ${{ secrets.PAT }}  # PAT stored as a secret
        run: |
          git config --global user.name "Aryan"
          git config --global user.email "23f2001216@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"

          echo "Daily commit on $(date)" >> daily-log.txt

          git add daily-log.txt
          git commit -m "Automated daily commit on $(date)"

          ls -la
          git status

          git push origin main  
          git push "https://${{ secrets.PAT }}@github.com/${{ github.repository }}.git" main

```
