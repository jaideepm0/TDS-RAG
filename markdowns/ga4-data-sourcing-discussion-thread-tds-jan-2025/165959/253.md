## Image Description

The image displays a code snippet in a programming environment. The code appears to be a JSON representation of a weather forecast for specific dates, including:

- **2025-01-01:** Sunny with scattered clouds
- **2025-01-02:** Partly cloudy with a chance of rain
- **2025-01-03:** Overcast skies
- Additional days are indicated by a comment.

Below this section, there is a query asking for the weather forecast description for "Nur-Sultan" with specific dates and conditions listed, ranging from light snow to sunny intervals. 

An error message at the bottom reads: 
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')
```

The interface also features a "Check" button and a display area for the date and forecast details.
```
