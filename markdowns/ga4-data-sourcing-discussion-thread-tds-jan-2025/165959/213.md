I didn’t get any error for Astana.  
The error may be due to incorrect loops in your code that’s why it’s going out of range, check for that.

# Image Description

The image displays a screenshot from a coding environment (likely Jupyter Notebook) focused on weather data scraping. 

## Key Elements

- **File Name**: `bbc-weather-scraping.ipynb`
- **Table View**: The upper section shows a table with weather data:
  - **Time** (format: HH:MM)
  - **Temperature** (in degrees Celsius)
  - **Wind** (descriptions such as "gentle breeze" and "moderate breeze")
- **Data Entries**:
  - For example, on "25-02-21": 
    - 17:00 → "Thick cloud and a gentle breeze"
    - 18:00 → "Light snow and a gentle breeze"
    - 19:00 → "Sunny and a gentle breeze"
  
- **Code Cell**: The lower part contains a Python command (`df.to_json`) that converts the dataframe into a JSON format, indicating records of weather data. 

## Additional Information
- The interface includes options for editing, runtime, and sharing.
- There is a "Cannot save changes" message indicating restrictions on the current session.
