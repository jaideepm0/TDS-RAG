Hi Team,

I have made the JSON from the IMDB website using JS, But do i miss any filter conditions,  

```markdown
# Image Description

The image displays a digital interface that appears to be related to a JSON data query or output. 

## Components:

- **Text Section**: 
  - The top part contains a question: "What is the JSON data?" followed by a JSON snippet that outlines details for a movie with a release year (2024) and a rating (6.0).
  - The JSON snippet shows an "id" field with a corresponding value.

- **Error Message**: 
  - An error message is present, indicating a mismatch in expectations: "Expected: '11. Sebastian Fitzek: Der Heimweg'. Actual: '11. The Calendar Killer'".
  - Additional information notes that IMDb search results may differ by region and suggests manually translating titles.

- **Visual Style**: 
  - The layout uses a dark theme with a text box format, typical of programming or query tools.

```

  
I took first 25 films which 5 to 6 rating, but json seems to be different.

Could anyone please tell me what i did wrong here?
