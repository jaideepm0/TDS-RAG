For those who didn’t submit but still need to practice the questions like to check if the answer is right, or cross-check the solutions for GA 4 and GA 5, is there a special link where the portal just checks the answer and says right or wrong. I wasn’t able to do GA4 or even try to attempt GA 5 before deadline, but i would like to go through the process of submitting etc. is there any link or solutions for GA 4 and GA5.
