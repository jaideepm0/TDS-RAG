As per instruction we need to create a directory in that we should have .yml file. But I tried with there were two issues (1) Github has not allowed to run the file (as there was no menu is available to run manually) (I checked with Copolit AI it says it is not correct to have cron jobs in a directory, I am not sure) (2) when I submit the url to iitm I got the following error  

```markdown
# Image Description

The image contains instructions related to using GitHub workflows. 

## Key Points:
- The instructions mention that files should be located in the `.github/workflows/` directory.
- Steps to follow after creating the workflow include:
  - Triggering the workflow and waiting for it to complete.
  - Ensuring the workflow appears as the most recent action in the repository.
  - Verifying that it creates a commit during or within 5 minutes of the workflow run.
  
## Additional Information:
- There is a prompt for entering the repository URL, formatted as:
  `https://github.com/USER/REPO`.
  
## Error Message:
- An error message at the bottom states: 
  `YAMLParseError: Implicit keys need to be on a single line at line 1, column 1: <!DOCTYPE html>`.
```

  
I removed the directory and submitted the same url I got the following error  

```markdown
### Image Description

The image displays a user interface for entering a GitHub repository URL. 

- **Text Field**: There is a text input area with a placeholder text prompting the user to enter the repository URL in the format: `https://github.com/USER/REPO`.
- **Entered URL**: The URL `https://github.com/23f2003853/workflows` is entered.
- **Error Message**: Below the input field, a red error message states: "Error: No executed job step matches 23f2003853@ds.study.iitm.ac.in".
- **Button**: There is a blue button labeled "Check".

The overall layout suggests an interactive form for repository verification.

I do not know what to do next. Can TA help us
