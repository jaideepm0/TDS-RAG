> For question 2 getting Error: At [8].title: Values don’t match. Expected: “9. Un matrimonio di troppo”. Actual: “9. You’re Cordially Invited” But this movie is not found when searched by name

the movie may have different title on IMDb (perhaps in another language) according to region which is why there isnt an exact match u can manually format it to get marks
