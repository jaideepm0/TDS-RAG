Sir, I received the mail today -  

```markdown
# Pre-requisites Check

**Results:** (1 for pass, 0 for fail)

- **Docker repo exists and is public** (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): **1**
- **Github repo exists and is public** (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): **1**
- **Github repo check** - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): **0**
- **Github repo check** - Dockerfile exists: **1**
```

  
Sir, I had already added the LICENSE and changed it to’MIT LICENSE’ due to this reason before the deadline itself.  

```markdown
