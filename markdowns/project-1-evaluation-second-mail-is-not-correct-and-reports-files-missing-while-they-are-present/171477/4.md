Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton),

Iâ€™m experiencing the same issue mentioned in this thread regarding Project 1 evaluation emails:

1. The first email I received confirmed all requirements were met (public repo, MIT License, Dockerfile, etc.)
2. The second email incorrectly flagged missing files despite their presence in my repository

Here are screenshots of both emails showing the discrepancy:

Dear Learner,

We have evaluated your project 1 docker image submission. Please find the following files:

1. **Evaluation log file:** [evaluation log link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uHkYQ61sud2z_bklmkmF7bMLzsyw2tps/view)  
   This contains your performance report for your individual tasks.

2. **Docker log file:** [docker log link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SRWg531R0N6O0sY4Xk47_LoMTyiv/view)  
   This provides the technical performance of your container.

3. **Server start log file:** (See attachment)  
   Your docker service did not start or respond as expected.

4. **Evaluation script file:** (See attachment)  
   This file has the actual tests that were run against your submission and the scoring mechanism.

5. **Data generation file:** (See attachment)  
   The evaluation file depends on this file to create the data for the tasks.

6. **Docker orchestration file:** (See attachment)  
   This handles the retrieval of your docker image for docker hub and binding of your container instances. It also sends the environmental variables that will be required for your container to function and the port mappings for communications.

7. **Solution script:** (See attachment)  
   This resolves the entire project 1 using prompt engineering only. This is a sample example of what can be achieved by leveraging the core concepts of LLMs to achieve the desired result.

This is the ID of the docker image that was evaluated: **b03b89ee0b17**

These scores are not final but they indicate what our current evaluation standards will score you.

If you have discovered a bug in our scripts or have a discrepancy to report with how the various scripts functions then we are happy to address your concern and where necessary make amendments to your score.

We will allow next Tuesday to report any problems. After which the score will be considered final. We will listen to feedback and then come up with a final marking schema.

**Message:**

Dear Learner,

Project 1 requires you to pass some pre-requisite checks as detailed on the [TDS Project 1 Evaluation](link) page:

2. Your GitHub repository has a LICENSE file with the MIT license.
3. Your GitHub repository has a valid Dockerfile.
4. Your Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via `podman run -e AIRPROXY_TOKEN=$AIRPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`.
5. Your Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in your GitHub repository.

If you fail to meet this minimum requirement, your submission will not get evaluated.

**Project 1 Prerequisite evaluations:**

My GitHub repo remains publicly accessible with all required components:  
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/23f2000345/TDS_final)

Could you please confirm this was an automated error and that my submission will be evaluated based on the actual repository contents? Your clarification would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and assistance!
