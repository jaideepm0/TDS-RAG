Good Morning Sir, Actually even I got the mail regarding Project-1 Evaluation, where I got the message like the prerequisites were not met. But, sir actually I have uploaded my MIT License file, requirements.txt file, my Project.py file and the Dockerfile. Sir, and when I sent a request to my API from my device, it worked sir. I have got 0 in my project 1 sir, but I have met the pre-requisites Can you please check this once sir?

My GitHub repository for Project-1: [GitHub - sudhishssn134/project\_1\_tds](https://github.com/sudhishssn134/project_1_tds)

Thanking You

Just attaching the mail I recieved.

     - Evaluation log.
     - Docker log for performance metrics.
     - Server start log.
     - A separate evaluation script.
