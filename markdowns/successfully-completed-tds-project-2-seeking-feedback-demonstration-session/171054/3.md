Thank you for the opportunity! However, I won’t be able to present the project in a public session as my **Azure API URL would be exposed**, and since it incurs **costs per usage**, I need to keep it secure.

I’d prefer a **private meet** to demonstrate the project. Please let me know if that can be arranged. Looking forward to discussing it!
