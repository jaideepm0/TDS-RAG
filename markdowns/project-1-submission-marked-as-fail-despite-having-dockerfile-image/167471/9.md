So the reason for the failure is:

You had initially put your Dockerfile inside a directory called TDSP-1-main instead of being directly in your repo. (On 15th Feb 1:26AM)

Then when our automated script checked if students repos met the requirements and yours did not we immediately sent out a warning email as a opportunity for students to make the necessary corrections.

Then once you realised your mistake, on **Feb 17th at 9:11 pm IST** i.e *yesteday*, you changed your repo to put the files in the correct locations.

Then you finally posted here on Discourse with the image [quote=“21f3002647, post:1, topic:167471”]  

```markdown
# Directory Structure

The image displays the directory structure of a project. Below are the contents listed:

- **Folders**
  - `..` (Parent Directory)
  - `LLM_PROJECT1`
  - `__pycache__`

- **Files**
  - `Dockerfile`
  - `LICENSE`
  - `app.py`
  - `datagen.py`
  - `evaluate.py`
  - `requirements.txt`
  - `tasksA.py`
  - `tasksB.py`
```

showing that your files are in the correct place.

We do not take into consideration modifications to your repo after the deadline because then we would have to extend that curtesy to all students.

Kind regards
