Hey I just got a mail saying that my github repo has no Dockerfile present. and im confused .

It doesnt mention anywhere that the dockerfile must be present in the root directory as a requirement/prerequisite of the project.

In my case its present inside the app directory. Could the team help clarify on this issue.
