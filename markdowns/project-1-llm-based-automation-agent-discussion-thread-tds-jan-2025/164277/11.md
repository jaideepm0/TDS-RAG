Hi Aishik,

Pls add context to your query, without that we won’t be able to understand, where exactly you are facing problem.

 23f2005325:

> ```
> openai.AuthenticationError: Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_issuer'}}
>
> ```

Possible reasons for this issue:

1. Not using anand sir’s proxy url for sending requests.
2. Token not being correct.
