# Image Description

The image displays a web browser with the following characteristics:

- **URL Bar**: The URL shown is `http://127.0.0.1:18000/run?task=Install%20...`
- **Content**:
  - A JSON response indicating success:
    ```json
    {
      "success": "Executed https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datam.py with email trial@gmail.com"
    }
    ```
- **Environment**: The data appears to be from a local server, given the IP address `127.0.0.1`.

The overall context suggests that a script or program has been successfully executed, retrieving a Python file from a GitHub repository.
```

Im able to execute the query succesfully.

# Directory Listing

The image displays a file directory on a computer:

## Current Path
- **Location:** This PC > Acer (C:) > data

## Folders and Files
- **Folders:**
  - `docs`
  - `logs`
  
- **Files:**
  - `comments`: Type - Text Source File, Size - 10 KB, Modified - 16-02-2025 11:58
  - `credit_card`: Type - JSON Source File, Size - 9 KB, Modified - 16-02-2025 11:58

## View Options
- **Sort:** Available options likely for arranging files by name, date, or type.
- **View:** Options for grid or list views of files.
```

But the data gets downloaded to C drive instead of the project folder  
The datagen.py file is in the project folder itself.

### Code Description

The image displays a snippet of Python code that performs the following functions:

1. **Line 35**: A comment explaining that all files are accessed from the 'data' folder within the project root.
   
2. **Line 36**: Defines `PROJECT_ROOT`, which stores the absolute path to the current working directory using `os.path.abspath()` and `os.getcwd()`.

3. **Line 37**: Defines `DATA_DIR`, which joins the `PROJECT_ROOT` with the string "data" to create a path for the 'data' directory.

4. **Line 38**: A blank line for readability.

5. **Line 40**: A comment noting that the `data` directory should be ensured to exist, followed by a command that uses `os.makedirs()` to create the `DATA_DIR`, allowing for its existence to not raise an error if it already exists (due to `exist_ok=True`).
```

am I making any error when setting the directories?

Please help, have been facing this issue since the beginning of this project, initially tried to move the files from C drive to project folder but that does not seem like a viable solution.
