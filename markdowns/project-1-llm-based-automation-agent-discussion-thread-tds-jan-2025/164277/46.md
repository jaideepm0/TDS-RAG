the model keeps wrong answer, it says uvicorn for uv and has no info on how to run uv even after explicitly giving instructions(basically an older model) , basic “ls” command is also wrong, among other things. You can check your logs with respect to my api key.  
Do you think we could access a better model?

Maybe Download Deepseek 70b or even 671b and create an api while y’all run the model locally, in the long it would be cheaper for the course?  
because the model doesn’t know basic commands after telling how to do it.  
So if the model gives us wrong commands 2/3 times then how would we even solve the question.  
I spent a week on this just saying
