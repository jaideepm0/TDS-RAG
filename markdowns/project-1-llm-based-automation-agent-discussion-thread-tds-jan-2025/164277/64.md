[@21f3002390](/u/21f3002390) - AI Proxy is working and you *did* get the result. You can ignore any `costError`. It won’t happen in the future anyway.

**What’s happening?** I was trying to generate a unique hash for each request, as a precursor to caching requests. But I made a mistake in the code. Specifically, `crypto.createHash` is not supported in CloudFlare. [I fixed that](https://github.com/sanand0/aiproxy/commit/5943b6d355deffff88ac07d17aa0c6969cacc3d5) by removing this. I’ll introduce caching later if required.
