Sir earlier my code was running fine, but after the assigment of the new token,  
it is now showing 400 bad request, which simply implies there is something wrong with the token…  
plz do something sir…

## Image Description

This image displays a terminal or console output showing HTTP request logs. The logs indicate two requests made to the server:

1. **Request 1**
   - **IP Address**: 127.0.0.1
   - **Port**: 51794
   - **Method**: POST
   - **Endpoint**: `/run?task=TheSQLite+database+file...`
   - **Response Code**: 400 Bad Request

2. **Request 2**
   - **IP Address**: 127.0.0.1
   - **Port**: 51797
   - **Method**: GET
   - **Endpoint**: `/read?path=/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt`
   - **Response Code**: 404 Not Found

The terminal uses a dark theme with colored text to differentiate between normal and error messages. The logs appear to be part of a debugging process for web application requests.
```

I have do have cross verified the new token been correctly been assigned to the system variable…
