# Image Description

The image contains a form with two questions:

1. **GitHub Repository Link:**
   - Prompt: "What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 1?"
   - Example format provided: `https://github.com/user-name/repository-name`
   - Given response: `https://github.com/Atimanas-Biswal421/proj1`
  
2. **DockerHub Image Name:**
   - Prompt: "What is the name of the image published on DockerHub?"
   - Example format provided: `user-name/image-name`
   - Given response: `atimanasibwal/proj1-tds:final`
   - A red warning message indicating: "Must match pattern"

The form fields have a clean layout, with the first question field appearing above the second.
