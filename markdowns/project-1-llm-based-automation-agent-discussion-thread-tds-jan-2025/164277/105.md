Respected [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton) and [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) ,

Is anyone actively monitoring the Discourse page? I have been raising this issue for the past few days, but there has been no response. Does this mean the TAs are not addressing studentsâ€™ concerns?

I am encountering the following error while running my project with these LLM endpoints:

* **<https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions>**
* **<https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings>**  
  ```markdown
## Image Description

The image displays a JSON-like error message indicating an API error. The content includes:

- **Error Code**: 429
- **Message**: "On 2025-02 you used $2.002295600000011, exceeding $2"
  
The text is rendered in a code-style font, likely suggesting it is from a programming or development environment.
```  
  This issue is blocking my progress, and I urgently need assistance to resolve it. Kindly provide guidance or suggest a solution at the earliest.

Looking forward to your response.

Thanks,  
Telvin Varghese
