[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) Is there something like peer-review in the project, I found this in the grading document.

# Image Description

The image contains the following text:

**"P1 and P2 will have two components - Submissions and peer reviews with weightage 80:20."**

This statement outlines the components and their respective weightage for P1 and P2.

## Image Description

The image contains a simple table with two rows and one column. 

- The first row is labeled **"Peer Review Date"** and contains a dash ("-"), indicating that no date is set.
- The second row displays the date **"Tuesday, February 25, 2025."**

The table has a border outlining its structure.
