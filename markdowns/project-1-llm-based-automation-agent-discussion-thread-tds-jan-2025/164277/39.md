Ok. So just to confirm, since there are files with the same name, the json file should map the filepath and not the filename to the title right?  

```markdown
### Image Description

The image displays a section of text that appears to be a step or instruction concerning the handling of Markdown (`.md`) files located in the `/data/docs/` directory. The key points are as follows:

- **Title of the Task**: A6
- **Instructions**:
  - Find all Markdown files in the specified directory.
  - For each file, extract the first header line (indicated by `#`).
  - Create an index file named `/data/docs/index.json` that maps each filename (excluding the path) to its corresponding title.

- **Example Output**: 
  - The image includes a JSON-like structure that illustrates the expected format of the index file, mapping filenames to titles.

The layout features highlighted textual elements that emphasize certain parts of the instructions.
