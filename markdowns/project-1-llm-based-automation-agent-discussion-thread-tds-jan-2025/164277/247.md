A silly Doubt though but still a doubt!  
Could we create an image first of our project in initial stage(ie the my “app.py” is not completely ready) but I have build an docker image including the app.py and other dependencies.  
Should I give the same url now and then carry on updating the app.py  
Or, Should first complete and then upload in the form!

plz reply!!
