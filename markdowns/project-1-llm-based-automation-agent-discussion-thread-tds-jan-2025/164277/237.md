Hello Sir [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
What are implications on missing the project 1.  
Due to some personal reasons I wasn’t able to start any work on my project 1. It seems difficult for me to complete it.  
Could you please tell what will be the implications of missing it. Will I in anyway be able to cover up and pass in the subject doing future assignments and projects?

Thank you
