It clearly says in your error message:

Invalid value: ‘json’

if you look at the “type” key in your response\_format variable at the top,

the value cannot be “json”

The error is telling you what the supported values are

‘json\_object’, ‘json\_schema’, and ‘text’

Since you are defining a schema the correct value should be ‘json\_schema’

So therefore you should change

```
"type": "json"

```

to

```
"type": "json_schema"

```

If you have trouble constructing Json schemas,  
either feed it to gpt and have it correct it (along with your error) or please go over Module 3, in particular

<https://tds.s-anand.net/#/llm-text-extraction>

There is a clear example you can use as a template. We use the same one as a template when we do it in the sessions. That way you will make less errors.

Kind regards
