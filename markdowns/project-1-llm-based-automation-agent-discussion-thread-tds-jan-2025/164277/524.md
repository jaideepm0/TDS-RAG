sir for this task- A6 Find all Markdown (`.md` ) files in `/data/docs/` . For each file, extract the first occurrance of each H1 (i.e. a line starting with `#`  ). Create an index file `/data/docs/index.json` that maps each filename (without the `/data/docs/` prefix) to its title (e.g. `{"README.md": "Home", "path/to/large-language-models.md": "Large Language Models", ...}` ) …I am getting correct result for all files but for the very first file budget.md it shows wrong.  
my result- { “budget.md”: “Success easy same main modern doctor.”,  
“build.md”: “Shoulder follow own never above.”,  
and in the data files there is different heading in budget.md.- # Series dog who make specific agree between.  
my question is this if it works for all the files then why not for this file budget.md [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)
