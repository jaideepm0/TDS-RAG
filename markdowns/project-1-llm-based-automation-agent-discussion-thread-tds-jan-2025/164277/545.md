Nice bro, if its getting 8 you are sorted, probably get more later. But Prompting seems a little less info  
BUT

|  | Structured Outputs | JSON Mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Outputs valid JSON | Yes | Yes |
| Adheres to schema | Yes (see supported schemas) | No |
| Compatible models | gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o-2024-08-06, and later | gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4-\* and gpt-4o-\* models |
| Enabling | response\_format: { type: json\_schema, json\_schema: {strict: true, schema: â€¦} } | response\_format: { type: json\_object } |

```
    try:
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o-mini",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
            temperature=0,
            response_format={"type": "json_object"}
        )

```

you are taking a chance on that format
