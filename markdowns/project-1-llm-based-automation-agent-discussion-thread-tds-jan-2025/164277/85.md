We will be doing project session on ~~Tuesday 9 Feb~~ [correction] Tuesday 11th of Feb (thanks [@23f1002382](/u/23f1002382) [@23f2000237](/u/23f2000237)) . Project 1 uses the things you learnt in week 1-3. But mostly week 2 & 3.

We dont do it in the beginning, (but introduced it 2 weeks ago in a live session), to give students chance to practise the new learnings from week 2 & 3.

The plan has always been to demonstrate a few tasks and have you try doing the rest.

Kind regards
