Sir in main.py file I’m defining task with different variables . But in evaluate.py tasks are defined by different variables to test and when I’m testing it using python evaluate.py it returns unsuccessful . I’m testing all my tasks of main.py with Postman it returns successful.  
My query is that how the tasks get evaluated and do i need to change my variables in main.py ? And what are the other things i have to change.  
Also plss update evaluate.py fie with phase B tasks
