## Image Description

The image displays a snippet of Python code for a function named `run_datagen`. The function is designed to extract a URL and an email from a given task description. 

### Code Breakdown:

1. **Regular Expressions**:
   - It utilizes `re.search()` to look for a Python script URL and a user email address in the `task_description`.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - If the URL or email is not found, it returns an error message.

3. **File Operations**:
   - It constructs a file path for a script named `datagen.py` located in `PROJECT_ROOT` and uses the `requests` library to download the script from the specified URL.

4. **Utility Installation Check**:
   - The code checks if a utility 'uv' is installed. If not, it attempts to install it using `pip`.

5. **Executing the Script**:
   - Finally, it runs the downloaded script with the retrieved email address.

### Additional Notes:

- The code includes proper error handling and uses subprocess commands for executing scripts and installing packages.
- Syntax highlights are used for better readability, indicating keywords and functions in different colors.

I am also running datagen.py in the project directory, yet data folder is created in C drive.
