Sir I haven’t initaiated the podman earlier.  
Now when i try to use podman using the wsl via the code “sudo apt install -y podman” it is asking for the password…  
The problem is:

1. I haven’t set any password for podman earlier.
2. Though it is asking for password but it is not taking any input.(ie I am unable type anything there).  
   what should I am supposed to do…

# Terminal Session Log

The image displays a terminal session with the following characteristics:

- **User**: `psychocode2011`
- **Commands Executed**:
  - `sudo apt update`
  - `sudo apt install y podman`

### Key Points
- Multiple attempts to provide a password are noted.
- Messages indicate incorrect password entries.
- The user is prompted to enter the password several times, culminating in a series of "Sorry, try again" messages.

### Interface:
- The left section of the image shows the terminal window with command feedback.
- The right section indicates the open file structure, with a focus on a `powershell` folder.

### Overall Context:
This is a session typical for system updates or installations in a Linux-like environment, highlighting password authentication challenges.
