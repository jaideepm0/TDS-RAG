For the question #A8 on recognizing the credit card number in the image, Open AI doesnâ€™t seem to be recognizing the number correctly and as a result the evaluation is failing. What should be the solution?

## Image Description

The image captures a terminal or command-line interface displaying HTTP requests and responses associated with extracting a credit card number from an image file. 

### Key Components:

- **Running Task:** The task involves extracting a credit card number from an image located at `/data/credit_card.png` and writing it to `/data/credit-card.txt`.
  
- **HTTP Requests:**
  - A POST request is made to `http://localhost:8000/run`, including parameters for processing the image.
  - The request returns a `200 OK` status, indicating successful processing.

- **HTTP 200 Response:**
  - It includes the function `extract_numbers_from_image` with arguments specifying the input and output file paths.
  
- **Expected and Result Sections:**
  - The expected output (located at `/data/credit-card.txt`) contains a credit card number formatted as `402639936359356`.
  - The result section reflects the output from the extraction process.

### Visual Elements:
- Standard terminal aesthetics with colored text indicating various statuses (for example, yellow for ongoing tasks and red for expected results).
