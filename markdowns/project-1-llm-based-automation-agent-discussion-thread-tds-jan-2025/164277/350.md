# Image Description

The image displays a code editor environment, specifically Visual Studio Code, running in a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) terminal. 

## Key Elements

- **File Explorer Pane**: On the left side, there is a file explorer showing a directory structure with folders named `my_app`, `data`, and a text file named `re.txt`.
  
- **Editor Window**: The main section of the window features a file named `Dockerfile`, which contains Docker commands for setting up a container based on Python. The script includes commands like:
  - `FROM python:3.12-slim-buster`
  - Instructions for installing necessary packages and setting up the environment.

- **Terminal Pane**: The lower section shows a terminal executing commands related to a Python script named `app.py`. There is an API request being made using HTTP POST, indicating interaction with a web service.

## Background

- The environment is themed with a dark mode UI.
- The top title bar indicates the system is running Ubuntu within WSL.

This setup suggests a development environment focused on Python application and Docker containerization.
