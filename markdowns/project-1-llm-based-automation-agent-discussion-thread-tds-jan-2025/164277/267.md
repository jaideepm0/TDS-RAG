## Image Description

The image shows a screenshot of the Visual Studio Code application on a computer. 

### Key Features:
- **Error Message**: An alert window titled "Visual Studio Code" is displayed, indicating "The window is not responding" with options to "Reopen," "Close," or "Keep Waiting."
- **Code Snippet**: Below the alert, there is a portion of code visible that shows a line: `10 == 0` which appears to be part of a programming script.
- **Background**: The interface has a dark theme, typical of code editors, with a terminal section visible at the bottom showing the label "TERMINAL."
