I’m getting an error in task a2, def do\_a2():  
“”“Format markdown using prettier”“”  
format\_md\_path = DATA\_ROOT / “format.md”  
subprocess.Popen([“prettier”, str(format\_md\_path), “–write”, “–parser”, “markdown”])  
print(“data formatted successfully”)

any idea how to fix this? Also in A8, a 5 and a 3 is getting interchanged. Can someone help why that is hapening, I changed the prompt to include caution about not switching 3 and 5 as well, that didn’t help either
