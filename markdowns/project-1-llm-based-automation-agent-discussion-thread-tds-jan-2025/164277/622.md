I would like to sincerely thank the course faculty [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) for their support on the project throughout the week. They were so patient in listening to our issues and helping us resolve them, even if the issues were repeated.

I was not able to complete some or maybe many of the tasks but overall, it was a very good learning for me, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Thanks very much again for your guidance and support.

Regards,  
Swati
