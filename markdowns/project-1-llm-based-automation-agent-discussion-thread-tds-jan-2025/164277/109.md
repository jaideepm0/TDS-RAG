Hi Telvin

You have run out of tokens. Thats what the message is saying. You ran out 3 days ago. It was clearly mentioned that the limit is $1. You have exceeded $2.

```markdown
# Large Language Models

This module covers the practical usage of large language models (LLMs) â€“ a relatively new area.

**LLMs incur a cost.** We have created API keys for everyone with an `iitm.ac.in` email to use `gpt-4-0-mini` and `text-embedding-3-small`. **Your usage is limited to $1 per calendar month for this course. Don't exceed that.**

## Use AI Proxy instead of OpenAI. Specifically:
1. Replace your API to `https://api.openai.com/...` with `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/...`
2. Replace the `OPENAI_API_KEY` with the `AIPROXY_TOKEN`.

In our current internal build of project 1, we have yet to exceed $0.50

As to whether it can be renewed is something we have still not yet decided, because the question you have raised equally would apply to everyone. Raising it for you means raising it for everyone. $1 for everyone equals raising it by $1600+ *(i.e Rs 1.39 Lakhs)* for us!

The budget question then involves more than one person. It also involves the BS Team Operations and not just the TDS team and therefore instead of responding with a response that is not useful, we typically try to solve the problem first and then respond.

In short we are working on it. But as we have mentioned repeatedly in our sessions, use APIs efficiently, thats part of the skill. As soon as we have a resolution we will inform everyone via an announcement and an email.

Kind regards
