## Image Description

The image contains a snippet of text that outlines specific tasks related to data extraction:

1. Extract the sender's email address from a source and save it to `/data/email-sender.txt`.
2. Reference to an image file, `/data/credit-card.png`, which contains a credit card number. The instruction is to extract the card number from the image, ensuring there are no spaces, and save it to `/data/credit-card.txt`.
```

On task A8, credit-card.png is given, but it is in credit\_card.  
it makes the errors. I checked that 2 to 3 tasks depend on these, and we create the ouput file with ‘-’ this only. please clarify that output and input files name ‘-’ or ‘\_’ [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)
