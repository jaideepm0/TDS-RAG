Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Facing some issues in running my project. Taking an example of the Phase A - A3 task.

I am able to read my files through the GET/read/data/dates.txt query.  
I am also able to use the count\_wednesdays function through the POST/run task/count\_wednesdays.

But when I am entering a query such as “count\_wednesdays in data/dates.txt” I am unable to get a response.  

```markdown
# Image Description

The image displays a section typical of a user interface for an API response. 

## Key Features:
- **Code Section**: 
  - Displays the HTTP status code `200`, indicating a successful request.

- **Details Section**: 
  - Labeled "Response body".

- **Response Body**:
  - Presents a JSON object with an error message:
    ```json
    {
      "error": "Could not understand the task"
    }
    ```
  - The JSON block is highlighted against a dark background, with the error message in green text.
```

  
Please advice. Thank you.
