This project is one of the best experiences I had in the entire degree program. I could say this without any hesitation that what I learnt in the past 10 days >> last 3 months.

I really appreciate the idea of open internet type of evaluations, wherein, you implement things without any constraints, learning for the sake of implementing.

Doing this project, I also found many new ideas wherein function calling can be used to solve new problems. I also learned many new things from enthusiastic peers like [@23f1002382](/u/23f1002382) and also got the chance to help a few.

I thank the entire TDS team - [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir, [@carlton](/u/carlton) , [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) for their support throughout this amazing experience.
