I don’t think the project is too difficult to implement—it’s essentially a simple HTTP API for an AI agent that reads a task, converts it into parameters, and passes those parameters to specific functions to complete the task. However, the instructions in the project question aren’t very clear. Before the session, I am unable to fully understand the question. It took me almost an entire day just to understand what we need to do.  
Sir Could you provide test cases or a sample answer for Phase B?
