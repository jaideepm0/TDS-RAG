Hi [@Divya1](/u/divya1)

# Deliverables

‚≠ê

- **Create a new public GitHub repository**
- **Add an MIT LICENSE file**
- **Write and test your code.** Call `POST /run?task=...` with a few tasks and check if `GET /read?path=...` creates the correct files.
- **Commit and push your code**
- **Create a Dockerfile** that builds your application
- **Publish your Docker image publicly to Docker Hub**
- **Ensure that running your image via:**
  ```bash
  podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000
  ```
  automatically serves the API at `http://localhost:8000/run?task=...` and `http://localhost:8000/read?path=...`.

- **Submit in this Google Form the URL of your GitHub repository** (`https://github.com/user-name/repo-name`) and your Docker image name (`user-name/repo-name`).

Please do very carefully all things mentioned in the Deliverables as well as look at the Evaluation Section.  

```markdown
## Image Description

The image contains a section titled "Here's how we will score the results," detailing the pre-requisites for a GitHub repository evaluation. The content includes a list of criteria that must be met:

- **Pre-requisites**: Your repository MUST meet the following criteria to be eligible for evaluation:
  - Your GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible.
  - Your GitHub repository has a `LICENSE` file with the MIT license.
  - Your GitHub repository has a valid `Dockerfile`.
  - Your Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via:
    ```
    podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000
    ```
  - Your Docker image uses the same `Dockerfile` as in your GitHub repository.
```

We had a session on 28th Jan introducing all the important aspects of Project.

If you do not do everything exactly as mentioned **especially the pre - requisites** mentioned in the Evaluation section you will get 0 in the project and *there will be no appeal* for failing to meet the pre - requisites of the evaluation criteria.

In order for us to evaluate the project you have to provide the deliverables mentioned above.

Kind regards
