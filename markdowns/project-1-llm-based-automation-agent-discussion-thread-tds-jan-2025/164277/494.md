Here’s how to prompt folks. Just do what [@carlton](/u/carlton) mentioned in today’s live session (the 5 hour marathon) and you should be good for Project-1!

Most people are still prompting wrong.
I've found this framework, which was even shared by OpenAI President Greg Brockman.
Here’s how it works: [pic.x.com/2MMcEqBeIJ](https://x.com/aakashg0/status/1890492955842007087/photo/1)

# The Anatomy of an o1 Prompt

I want a list of the best medium-length hikes within two hours of San Francisco.

Each hike should provide a cool and unique adventure, and be lesser known.

For each hike, return the name of the hike as I'd find it on AllTrails, then provide the starting address of the hike, the ending address of the hike, distance, drive time, hike duration, and what makes it a cool and unique adventure.

Return the top 3.

Be careful to make sure that the name of trail is correct, that it actually exists, and that the time is correct.

**Context:** My girlfriend and I like to hike a ton! We've done pretty much all of the local SF hikes, whether that's Presidio or Golden Gate Park. We definitely want to get out of town — we did mountain biking recently, the whole thing from the beginning of the stairs to Stinson - it was really fun and we are definitely in the mood for another different weekend! Ocean views would still be nice. We love delicious food too, and if views are involved, that’d be great. The old mission hillside still attracts our attention for breakfast! The ideal misses are about discovering new spots, but I’ve still wanted to hike globally too. I’m at this point, I’m just looking for really unique hikes (my bf stays in LA for work so the uniqueness here really counts).
