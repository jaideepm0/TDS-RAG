Hi [@Rishabh2](/u/rishabh2)

What exactly you mean by variables? only one argument is required for running `evaluate.py` that’s an email address.

You need to download both `evaluate.py` and `datagen.py` in same folder and then execute `evaluate.py` using uv.  
`uv run evaluate.py --email $any_email`.

For phase B

Kind regards
