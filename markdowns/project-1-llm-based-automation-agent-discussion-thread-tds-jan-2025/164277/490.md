[@carlton](/u/carlton) needed a confirmation on this task

`A8 * `/data/credit-card.png` contains a credit card number. Pass the image to an LLM, have it extract the card number, and write it without spaces to `/data/credit-card.txt` - in this task i assume prompt can ask for credit card number or other details like cvv and name.

My question is, whether my system should allow prompt that CVV or or such info ? or should give it ?
