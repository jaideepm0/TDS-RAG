```
    expected = sum(1 for date in dates if parse(date).weekday() == 2)
    if result.strip() != str(expected):
        return mismatch("/data/dates-wednesdays.txt", expected, result)
    return True```



```

 /data/dates-wednesdays.txt  
 EXPECTED:  
129  
 RESULT:  
“129”

If it is expecting str then why throw error sir ? [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
or just tell me how to pass count as an int here

```
with open(output_file, "w") as f:
        f.write(str(count)) 

```
