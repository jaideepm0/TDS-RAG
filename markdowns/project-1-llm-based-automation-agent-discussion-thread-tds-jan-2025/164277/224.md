# Image Description

The image showcases a dual-screen setup:

## Left Screen:
- A web browser is open, displaying a local address: `http://localhost:5000`.
- The browser console has a message stating: `{"detail": "Not found"}`, indicating a 404 error.

## Right Screen:
- An integrated development environment (IDE) interface, possibly Visual Studio Code.
- The code section features Python code, likely part of a web application.
- The code includes imports from `fastapi`, a popular framework for building APIs in Python.
- A section of code appears to set up logging and defines an endpoint: `@app.delete()`.
- The terminal below the code indicates file changes with lines of code being added and deleted, specifically related to a project managed in Git.
- It shows output regarding file status and operations, particularly concerning a Dockerfile.

This illustrates a typical development environment for a web application.
