Hi Carlton,  
I am writing to confirm the basic requirements for successfully completing the course.

As I understand, the criteria for passing are:

1. Achieving a score greater than 40 marks in the graded assignments.
2. Securing more than 40 marks in the end-term examination.

Could you kindly confirm if this understanding is accurate? Additionally, please let me know if there are any other prerequisites to be met.---
