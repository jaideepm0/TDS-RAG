Hello Sir,

I am unable to recieve a proper output for q1 of ga3.  
This is my test message. Its been given in two lines.

```markdown
The image shows a code editor or text display with the following content:

```
2  b7 rkS94mn4
AM  dNG4j EVevK24Ev VEpI  G LeeHS
```

- The text consists of alphanumeric characters, arranged in two lines.
- The first line starts with the numeral "2" followed by "b7" and "rkS94mn4".
- The second line contains "AM", followed by various character combinations including "dNG4j", "EVevK24Ev", "VEpI", a single character "G", and "LeeHS".
- The overall color scheme appears to be a dark background with lighter text.
```

The below is my code for the question.

```
import httpx

url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer api_key",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

system_message = "Analyze the input message if it's  GOOD , BAD or NEUTRAL."
user_message = "2 b7 rkS94mn4  AM dNG4j EVevK24Ev VEpI G LeeHS"

payload = {
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": system_message},  # System message
        {"role": "user", "content": user_message}       # One user message
    ],
    "temperature": 0.7
}

response = httpx.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)

response.raise_for_status()

result = response.json()

for choice in result["choices"]:
    print("AI Response:", choice["message"]["content"])

```

I tried to put the two test lines as two user messages but received an error stating that the json body must contain only 2 messages with one mandatorily being a system message. With that in mind, i also tried the alternative

`user_message = "2 b7 rkS94mn4 \n AM dNG4j EVevK24Ev VEpI G LeeHS"`

The error message i keep receiving is as below.

```markdown
# Image Description

The image displays a text output that appears to be an error message, formatted in a coding environment. The message reads:

```
Error: The user message must be 2 b7 rkS94mn4 AM dNG4j EVevK24Ev VEpI G LeeHS, not 2 b7 rkS94mn4 AM dNG4j EVevK24Ev VEpI G LeeHS
```

Key points:
- The text is likely related to payload validation or processing.
- It indicates a problem with the user message format.
```

Kindly advice on how to proceed.

Thanks and Regards
