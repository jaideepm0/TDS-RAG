Hi guys, just wanted to share that I found it hysterical when I saw this question:  

```markdown
# Image Description

The image displays a screenshot of an online assignment interface. Key elements include:

- **Header Information**: 
  - Due date is noted as "Wed 5 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST".
  - Options to check, save, and score the assignment are visible.

- **Content Overview**: 
  - The assignment appears to focus on API integration with RapidRoute Solutions, a logistics and delivery company.
  - It discusses the challenges faced in verifying addresses for planning solutions and highlights the intent to integrate automated address validation using OpenAI's API.

- **Key Points**:
  - Instructions include:
    - A requirement to add certain fields in the JSON object, with a specific emphasis on including all fields and proper structure.
    - Mention of a sample request body format for integration with OpenAI's chat completion API.
    - A prompt to determine how to enable an API key as part of the task.

- **Visual Elements**: 
  - The bottom of the screenshot includes a taskbar with icons for various applications and a text field for user input.

The interface appears to be part of an educational platform for programming or API development.
```

  
Like I literally showed this question to my mother and younger bro, stating the fact we ourselves had enable the answer box, they laughed there pants offâ€¦  
More courses could be like this.
