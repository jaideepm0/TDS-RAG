## Image Description

- **Query Field**: A text box for entering an API URL. The example given is `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute`.
- **Error Message**: A red error message stating `SyntaxError: "undefined" is not valid JSON`, indicating an issue related to JSON formatting.
- **Instruction Text**: An explanatory note mentions that a GET request will be sent to the specified URL, and that it will check for a task with parameters provided in a specific format. 

The overall layout suggests that this is part of a web application related to API testing or configuration.

This is in context to Q8. This is a screenshot of the response I am getting when i run the same API on my FastAPI/docs response page, it gives the correct response. But when I check it on the assignment page i get the following error. If you would like to know the code, pls let me know. [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)
