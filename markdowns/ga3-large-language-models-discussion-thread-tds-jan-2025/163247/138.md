Hello, I think the format of the response body should be like: { “matches” : [ “ABC”, “ABC”, “ABC”]}. I think it is because of your formatting issue.

```markdown
# Image Description

The image displays a user interface of a tool for API testing, likely Postman or a similar application. The main aspects of the interface include:

- **URL Input**: A field showing the URL `http://127.0.0.1:18000/similarity`.
- **HTTP Method**: A dropdown indicating a `POST` request.
- **Authorization Section**: Indicates "No Auth," meaning the request does not require authorization.
- **Body Section**: Contains a JSON body with an array labeled "matches" consisting of three statements:
  - "FastAPI is great for APIs."
  - "Embedding models improve NLP."
  - "Machine learning is evolving."
- **Response Section**: Displays a `200 OK` status, indicating a successful request.
- **Interface Elements**: There are buttons for sending the request, and tabs for various sections like Params, Headers, and Body.

Overall, the layout is dark-themed, typical for coding environments.
```

I had used (well gpt) the below two decorators to format:

```
class SearchRequest(BaseModel):
    docs: List[str]  # The list of documents to search through
    query: str       # The search query string

class SearchResponse(BaseModel):
    matches: List[str]  # The list of matched documents

.........

@app.post("/similarity", response_model=SearchResponse)


.........

return SearchResponse(matches=sorted_matches[:3])

```

It basically checks the Request and Response formatting. This worked for me. Hope it helps. And thanks btw for mentioning using POSTMAN, as I had never used it before, so it clicked in my mind after reading your post only that I can basically debug using POSTMAN. Thank you for that
