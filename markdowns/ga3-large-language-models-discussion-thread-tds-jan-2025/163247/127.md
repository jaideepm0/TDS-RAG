Both the api based questions i am unable to get the output it always says bad request  

```markdown
## Image Description

The image displays a code editor interface with a file structure on the left sidebar. The main area contains Python code, specifically a function definition called `parse_query`. 

### Key Elements:
- **File Structure**: 
  - Folders and files such as `app`, `__pycache__`, `main.py`, `env`, and `requirements.txt` are visible in the sidebar.
  
- **Code Snippet**: 
  - The function `parse_query` processes a string input (`query`) to match certain patterns related to scheduling and expense balance.
  - Uses regular expressions (`re.match`) to capture specific components of the input.
  
- **Output Section**: 
  - At the bottom, there are logs displaying errors about a failed query: "Query format did not match any predefined patterns."
  - Displays HTTP-related errors indicating that a submitted request was not found (404) and that the server returned a bad request (400).
  
- **Environment**: 
  - Indicates that the Python version in use is 3.13.1 within a virtual environment named `venv`.

This image captures a moment of debugging or development within a Python application focusing on scheduling and financial query processing.
