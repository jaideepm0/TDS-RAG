Hello sir,

While working on this question, I’m encountering this problem. It looks like the request is being made successfully (and I verified it by a POST request via Postman ), however while submitting my URL at the assignment portal, I’m getting an error.

```markdown
### Image Description

The image displays a terminal or console output featuring informational log messages. Key points include:

- A local address (`127.0.0.1:59423`) is used for HTTP requests.
- The collection is reset successfully, and a new collection named "documents" is created.
- It indicates that 10 new documents have been added to the database.
- A query is being conducted regarding internal training on cybersecurity challenges.
- Found matches include:
  - "Employee training on cybersecurity best practices is being rolled out company-wide."
  - "The staff handbook has been updated to reflect current operational policies."
  - "Our quality assurance team has implemented automated testing protocols."
- Messages are formatted in a monospace font, typical of command-line interfaces.
```

  

## Image Description

The image contains text displayed in a dark-themed interface. 

- **API URL Endpoint Prompt**: 
  - The text asks, "What is the API URL endpoint for your implementation? It might look like: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`".
  
- **Error Message**: 
  - Below the prompt, an error message is shown in red which states: 
    - "Error: Got incorrect matches: Employee training on cybersecurity best practices is being rolled out company-wide. The staff handbook has been updated to reflect current operational policies. Our quality assurance team has implemented automated testing protocols."

The overall tone presents a technical context, likely related to software or API usage.

I even tried deploying on a public URL using render. My guess is there is a formatting issue or it’s not sorting correctly based on the similarity score and not returning the top 3.

Would appreciate if I can get some clarity on the same

Thanks and Regards  
Shalini
