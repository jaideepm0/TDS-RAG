**Q4**  
s3 string was given by

```
image_b64 = ""
import base64
with open('/content/TDS_wk3_q4.png', 'rb') as f:
    binary_data = f.read()
    image_b64 = base64.b64encode(binary_data).decode()
data_uri = f"data:image/png;base64,{image_b64}"

```

  
s4 string given by :   

used this [link](https://www.base64-image.de/)  to generate image url  
  
 Then checked them both, they were the same

```
for x,y in zip(s3,s4):
  if (x != y):
    print(x,y)

```

i verified that both were equal but still one gave the wrong answer(python code), while the online converter gave the right one?  
I know iâ€™m missing something, but why?
