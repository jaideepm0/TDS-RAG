Good Evening, I have a doubt regarding 7th and 8th question. I am getting this error of expecting three matches while saving. But, Externally when I check this API, I tried considerable test cases, and I am getting the output correctly. Can you please check this and give a solution. Thank You

The image displays a block of text formatted in a JSON-like structure. The text contains a single key, `matches`, which is associated with an array of three strings: `'banana'`, `'watermelon'`, and `'jamaica'`. The entire structure is enclosed in curly braces and uses single quotes for the strings.

## Image Description

The image displays a user interface element, likely a web development console or form. It contains the following text:

- A note reminding users to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow `OPTIONS` and `POST` methods, suggesting the permission of all origins and headers.
- A prompt asking for an API URL endpoint for implementation, providing an example: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`.
- An error message stating "Expected 3 matches," highlighted in red.

The background is dark, contrasting with the text. The input field appears highlighted or outlined in red, indicating an error present.
