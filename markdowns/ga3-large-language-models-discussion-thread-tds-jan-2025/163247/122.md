Sir, Regarding the embedding questions, I had posted earlier. Now, I am writing the error I faced. I tried to use the OpenAI API, but I am getting the error as “The Maximum Quota has reached”. I tried using 5 new API Keys from OpenAI, from 5 different accounts. So, I had to use SentenceTransformers, Alibaba gte model. So, as the model has changed, I think so it is expecting answer as got from OpenAI Model, but as I used Alibaba gte model, I am getting different result. Can you please explain how to solve this issue? This will be helpful in my future codes. I could do chat requests but it is not giving output for Embedding requests, I tried it multiple times with multiple different keys.Thank You
