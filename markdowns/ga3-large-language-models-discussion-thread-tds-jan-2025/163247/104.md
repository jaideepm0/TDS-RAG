## Image Description

The image displays an interface for checking an API URL endpoint configuration. 

- **Background Color**: Dark
- **Text**: 
  - Instruction to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).
  - An example API URL shown: `http://127.0.0.1:1800/execute`
  - A highlighted input field where the user can enter their API URL.
  - An error message stating "TypeError: Load failed."
