# Image Description

The image displays a screen with instructions for a quiz titled "TDS 2025 Jan GA3 - Large Language Model." Key details of the image include:

- **Date and Time:** The header shows "Ended at Wed, 5 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST."
- **Score and Action Buttons:** There are options to view the score, save answers, and check responses.
- **Instructions Section:** The instructions are numbered from 1 to 7, detailing various guidelines:
  1. **Learn what you need:** Encourages reading provided material.
  2. **Check answers regularly:** Advises using a "Check" button to verify answers.
  3. **Save regularly:** Instructs users to save their submissions, noting that multiple saves are allowed.
  4. **Browser issues:** Mentions possible problems with browsers and offers solutions.
  5. **Use resources:** Suggests using the internet, AI tools, or frameworks for assistance.
  6. **Hacking allowed:** States that hacking the code for answers is permitted within certain limits.
  7. **Multiple servers:** Notes that participants will run multiple servers for the exam simultaneously.

```

The score drops because some questions may require you to either keep a server turned on or some dynamic changes may occur for some questions (The dynamic changes are intentional in some questions, in order to get students to learn by doing. So if you solved everything and the score is the maximumâ€¦ just make that your last submission. The score you see is the score you will get for your last submission).

If you want check a question without submitting. Then just use the check button instead. But your last submission is whats scored.
