# Image Description

The image displays a code snippet in a programming environment, likely related to making API requests. Below are the key components of the code:

1. **API Endpoint:**
   - The code specifies the URL for the chat completions endpoint for GPT-4.

2. **Headers Setup:**
   - It includes headers for the request with `Authorization` and `Content-Type`.

3. **List of Supported Strings:**
   - There is a comment indicating a list of valid strings for usage.

4. **Request Preparation:**
   - The code prepares a JSON payload for the API, specifying the role and content of the messages.

5. **Sending the Request:**
   - The request is sent using a method that captures the response.

6. **Response Handling:**
   - The code checks if the request was successful and manages the response accordingly, including handling potential errors.

7. **Token Count:**
   - At the bottom, it shows the total tokens used in the request.

The coding style appears to be Python, given the syntax and structure.
