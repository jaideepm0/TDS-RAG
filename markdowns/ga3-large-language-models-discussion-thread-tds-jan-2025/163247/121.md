The error shows your code is getting wrong answers for the test cases. I looked into your code and noticed that you are using sklearn (I think which is not required in this case). Just get embedding vector for each document content and query by passing a valid POST request to <http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings> with required headers. And, then calculate `similarity_scores` simply using  
\cos(\theta) = \frac{\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}}{|\mathbf{A}| |\mathbf{B}|}  
which in python syntax is-

```
np.dot(vec1, vec2) / (np.linalg.norm(vec1) * np.linalg.norm(vec2))

```
