# Image Description

The image contains instructions regarding a dataset consisting of visitor log entries. It details the fields for each row, which include:

- **IP**: The IP address of the visitor.
- **Remote logname**: Typically represented as "-".
- **Remote user**: Also typically represented as "-".
- **Time**: The timestamp of the visit, formatted as `[01/May/2024:00:00:00 +0000]`.
- **Request**: The request made by the visitor, broken down into:
  - **Method**: e.g., `GET`
  - **URL**: e.g., `/blog/`
  - **Protocol**: e.g., `HTTP/1.1`
- **Status**: The HTTP status code, indicating success if between 200 and 299.
- **Size**: Size of the response in bytes.
- **Referer**: The URL from which the request originated.
- **User agent**: Information about the browser that made the request.
- **Vhost**: The virtual host referenced.
- **Server**: The IP address of the server.

Each field is separated by spaces and enclosed in double quotes. Notes also emphasize that data is in GMT-0500 timezone and describe the objective of analyzing this data:

1. **Optimize Infrastructure**: Manage resources to enhance user experience during peak traffic.
2. **Strategize Content Delivery**: Tailor digital strategies based on content popularity.
3. **Improve Marketing Efforts**: Focus on engagement during high traffic times.

Finally, a question prompts the reader to calculate the number of successful GET requests under `/blog/` from 1:00 PM until before 3:00 PM on Mondays. A response box indicates that the submitted answer was "1603," followed by an error message stating it is incorrect.

It seems that the question in *Graded Assignment 5 for TDS* is producing incorrect results despite the same logic working correctly for other variations of the problem. Please check into this question once as I have cross checked with many of the students and chatgpt and all of us faced this issue in this question. Thanks!

code to take reference from:

```
import gzip
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

log_path = 's-anand.net-May-2024.gz'
start_time = datetime.strptime('01:00:00', '%H:%M:%S').time()
end_time = datetime.strptime('15:00:00', '%H:%M:%S').time()
log_data = []

def parse_log(line):
    parts = line.split(' ')
    log_time = datetime.strptime(parts[3][1:], '%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S')
    method, url, status = parts[5][1:], parts[6], int(parts[8])
    return log_time, method, url, status

with gzip.open(log_path, 'rt') as file:
    for entry in file:
        log_time, method, url, status = parse_log(entry)
        if method == 'GET' and url.startswith('/blog/') and 200 <= status < 300:
            if log_time.weekday() == 0 and start_time <= log_time.time() < end_time:
                log_data.append(entry)

print(f"Successful GET requests: {len(log_data)}")

```

ps: I shared code after the deadline hopefully no issues there!
