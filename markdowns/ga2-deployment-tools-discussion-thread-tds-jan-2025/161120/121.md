# Network Response Preview

The image displays a browser window showing a JSON response from a local server. The response is formatted in a pretty-print style and includes an array of student objects.

## Details of the JSON Response

- The response consists of multiple student objects, each with the following attributes:
  - `studentId`: A unique identifier for each student (e.g., 57, 49, 134).
  - `class`: A string indicating the class the student is associated with (e.g., "11", "9W").

### Example Entries:
```json
[
  {"studentId": 57, "class": "9W"},
  {"studentId": 49, "class": "11"},
  {"studentId": 134, "class": "9W"},
  {"studentId": 110, "class": "11"},
  {"studentId": 1714, "class": "9W"},
  {"studentId": 1179, "class": "9W"}
]
```

## Browser Elements

  - **Status**: 200 (OK)
  - **Size**: 694 B transferred
  - **Time**: 12 ms to load

### Request Information
