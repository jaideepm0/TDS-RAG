Till yesterday I was able to login ngrok. But today it shows some error  

# Image Description

The image shows a web page titled "ngrok" with a focus on device activation. 

## Key Elements:
- **Header**: Displays the ngrok logo prominently.
- **Main Section**: Contains the following elements:
  - A text prompt: "Enter the code displayed on your device."
  - A code input area with a placeholder code: `4Z7AL0CA43M9SBDR43ZL77HKH840G13`.
  - A button labeled "Continue".
  - A link labeled "Back to QR Code".
- **Error Notification**: A pop-up message indicating an error: "The information supplied for MFA verification was invalid."
  
## Additional Details:
- The browser's tab indicates that the page is from the ngrok dashboard.
- The bottom of the page has a note: "Made with â™¥ by ngrok."
- The image appears to be taken on a Windows operating system, as suggested by the watermark at the bottom.
