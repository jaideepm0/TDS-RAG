Hi [@24f1002359](/u/24f1002359)

For **Question 10**, ensure that **all servers are running** every time you submit (click the **Save** button). Since **ngrok generates a new URL each time it runs**, double-check that the **ngrok URL is correct** before submitting.

For **Question 9**, did you **enable CORS**? To verify, check your **browser console**â€”if CORS is not enabled, you should see an error message indicating the issue.

```markdown
# Console Output

The image displays a web browser's developer console with the following entries:

1. **Log Messages:**
   - "starting ajax request to the resource."
   - "ajax request done."

2. **Error Message:**
   - "Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://google.com/' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource."

### Notes
- The messages indicate an issue with a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy preventing an AJAX request from being completed successfully.
```

For question 5, I have tried executed script with your set of parameters, your answer is correct. Will discuss it internally.

Kind regards.
