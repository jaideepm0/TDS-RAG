# Image Description

The image displays a view of a webpage from jsonlint.com, likely showing a formatted display of JSON data. 

## Key Features:
- **Left Side:** 
  - A column containing a structured list of JSON-like entries.
  - Each entry appears to be in a key-value format, primarily labeled as `"name"` followed by an integer.

- **Right Side:**
  - Mirrors the left side with a similar structured list of entries.
  
## General Observations:
- The entries seem to be uniformly structured, indicating they might be part of an array or a collection.
- The webpage design features a simple, minimalist layout without any additional images or complex styling. 

The image captures a moment of viewing data in a JSON format, emphasizing the readability and organization of JSON structures for users.
