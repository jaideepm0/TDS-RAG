Hi [@24DS1000121\_ULAGAOOZ](/u/24ds1000121_ulagaooz) ,

That’s because GitHub protects your email when an external website requests a GitHub Page. To disable this protection, create a `.nojekyll` file in your root folder of your repository.

# Image Description

The image displays a web development interface with two main sections:

## Left Panel
- A blue header region with a timer showing `01:19:33` left and score indicators (Score: 0/10).
- A text area containing the following:
  - A URL suggestion for GitHub Pages: `https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/`
  - An example URL: `https://luagaozhai.github.io/TDS-page/`
  - An error message indicating an issue with loading content, involving HTML structure and warnings related to the page's metrics.

## Right Panel
- Displays the DevTools console interface, with a "Preview" tab selected.
- The content shows a simple HTML document with a title "My Model Page" and a contact email link, formatted as "Contact me at: [email protected]".
- Underneath is a status bar indicating that 1 request was made and 0.8 KB was transferred.

Both sections provide insights into web development and debugging processes.

Kind regards
