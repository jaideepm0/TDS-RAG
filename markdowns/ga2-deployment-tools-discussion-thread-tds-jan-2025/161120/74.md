Hi Srividhya,

This error is because you are trying to access a feature of ngrok which requires to pay [ERR\_NGROK\_501 | ngrok documentation](https://ngrok.com/docs/errors/err_ngrok_501/#:~:text=Only%20Personal%2C%20Pro%2C%20Enterprise%2C%20or%20Pay-as-you-go%20accounts%20can,resolving%20this%20error%2C%20please%20reach%20out%20to%20support%40ngrok.com).

I think you didnâ€™t use authtoken to authenticate through your laptop. Follow second step on this page [Quickstart | ngrok documentation](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/) to authenticate.
