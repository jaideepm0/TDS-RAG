- **Query Parameter**: The section explains that if the URL has a query parameter `class`, it should return only students from specified classes.
- **Examples Provided**: An example is shown: `/api/class?class=1A&class=1B` should retrieve students from both classes.
- **CORS Policy**: There is a note on enabling CORS to allow GET requests from any origin.
- **API URL Endpoint**: A sample API URL is provided, looking like `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`.
- **Error Message**: The text shows an error message stating "TypeError: Failed to fetch".
