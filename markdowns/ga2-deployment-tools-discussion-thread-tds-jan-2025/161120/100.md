Sir I am getting this “TypeError: Load failed” for Q9 inspite of getting proper responses in “<http://127.0.0.1:8000/api>”, cors is also enabled. Please help me with this, I am finding it difficult to circumvent this.  

```markdown
## Image Description

The image displays a dark-themed interface, likely a code editor or a development environment. At the top, there is a message advising the user to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow GET requests from any origin. Below it, there is a prompt asking for the API URL endpoint for FastAPI, with an example provided: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`. 

A text input field is shown, where the user is expected to enter a URL. The entered value is `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`, which appears to be highlighted in red, indicating an error or issue. Below this, an error message states "TypeError: Load failed," suggesting a failure to load the API URL.

Overall, the interface is designed for developers to interact with APIs, with an emphasis on ensuring proper configurations for successful connectivity.

### Image Description

The image shows a code snippet formatted in a programming language, likely JavaScript or a similar syntax. It contains an array of student records, each represented as an object. Each object has two properties: `studentId` and `class`.

#### Key Components:
- The array is labeled `students`.
- It includes multiple entries:
  - `{ "studentId": 34, "class": "1A" }`
  - `{ "studentId": 353, "class": "1A" }`
  - `{ "studentId": 551, "class": "1A" }`
  - `{ "studentId": 829, "class": "1A" }`
  - `{ "studentId": 1309, "class": "1A" }`
  - `{ "studentId": 1795, "class": "1A" }`
  
The text appears formatted within a narrow viewport, indicating it may be from a code editor or browser console.
