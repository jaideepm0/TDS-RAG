Hi Mishkat,

I think url that you are submitting is wrong one. In below image there are two url’s under Domains those would be correct url’s to be submitted.  
For example `https://tds21jan.vercel.app/`.

# Image Description

The image displays a deployment interface, likely from a web development platform. Key elements include:

- **Deployment ID**: `tds2j1an-ghj37x7w-jivraj18s-projects.vercel.app`
- **Domains**:
  - `tds2j1an.vercel.app`
  - `tds2j1an-jivraj18s-projects.vercel.app`
- **Status**: 
  - `Ready`
  - Created 18 hours ago by `jivraj-18`
- **Source**: 
  - An option labeled `View code`
  - A command line entry showing `> vercel deploy`
- **Connection prompt**: A message encouraging the connection of a Git repository for production deployment.

The overall layout is dark-themed, typical of developer tools.

kind regards  
Jivraj
