Hi [@24ds1000082\_Vivek](/u/24ds1000082_vivek), [@23f3004114](/u/23f3004114) ,

You guys are not using correct format for response.

```
{
  "students": [
    {
      "studentId": 1,
      "class": "1A"
    },
    {
      "studentId": 2,
      "class": "1B"
    }, ...
  ]
}

```

This is correct for which have a object with key `students` which is not present in your response.

kind regards
