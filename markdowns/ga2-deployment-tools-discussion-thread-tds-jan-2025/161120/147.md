Week-2 Question-8, I am getting error

```markdown
## Image Description

The image displays a user interface related to Docker image URLs. It includes the following elements:

- A prompt asking, "What is the Docker image URL? It should look like:"
- A sample URL format displayed: 
  ```
  https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/$USER/$REPO/general
  ```
- Another URL is shown:
  ```
  https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/23f200573/first-rep/general
  ```
- An error message stating: 
  ```
  Error: 23f200573 is not one of the tags in https://hub.docker.com/v2/namespaces/23f200573/repositories/first-rep/tags
  ```
- A button labeled "Check" is present at the bottom.

The overall theme is a dark background with highlighted text areas for input and error messages.
```

I have pushed my image in the repository, pulled it and ran once, it worked

```markdown
The image shows a terminal window with a command line interface. The command executed is:

```
giri@GIRI:~$ docker run 23f2000573/first-rep:v1 abc.py
```
