For the Q.2 on image compression, for PNG, SVG or WEBP files, I’m getting the error “Could not process image. Is it browser supported image? Image pixels do not match the original” (I believe the last part is not applicable as the image was not processed ). Visually, I could not find any difference between the two files and the size of new file is less than 1,500 bytes.

Tried through Chrome v132.0.6834.83 without any add-ons/extensions.

```markdown
## Image Description

This image appears to be a user interface element for uploading an image file. It includes the following components:

- A prompt instructing the user to upload a losslessly compressed image that is less than 1,500 bytes.
- A button labeled "Choose File" for users to select their image file.
- A text field indicating the filename "shapes_compressed.png."
- An error message displayed in red text stating: "Could not process image. Is it a browser-supported image? Image pixels do not match the original."

The background is dark, which contrasts with the text and buttons.
