## Image Description

The image displays a snippet of code, likely written in Python. It features a function definition with decorators and type annotations. Key elements include:

- A decorator `@app.get("/api")` indicating a route for an API endpoint.
- The function `api` is defined with a parameter `class_`, which is annotated as a list of strings (`Annotated[list[str]`).
- The parameter has additional conditions, including a use of `Query` with an alias set to 'class'.
- The overall style suggests it is part of a web application framework, potentially FastAPI or a similar framework.

The background is dark, with syntax highlighting providing colors for different elements like keywords, types, and variable names.
