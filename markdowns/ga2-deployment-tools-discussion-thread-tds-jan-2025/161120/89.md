for the tunneling, i am currently unable to do it has the ports are mismatched, I’m still working on the issue, but using codespaces and public ports i’ve achieved similar results and the question is marked right. Is this wrong/unethical. I will try to tunnel using ngrok though

## Image Description

The image contains a snippet of text that appears to be instructions for working with a model named "Llama." 

1. **Instruction to Download**: 
   - "Download Llamafile."
   - "Run the Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Q6 K.llamafile model with it."

2. **Creating a Tunnel**: 
   - "Create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using ngrok."

3. **Ngrok URL Example**: 
   - "What is the ngrok URL? It might look like: https://[random].ngrok-free.app/"

4. **Response Indication**: 
   - The word "Correct" is displayed at the bottom, indicating a confirmation or approval of the input or action taken.

The overall look of the image is typical of a coding or technical interface, possibly from a terminal or a code editor, featuring a dark background with colored text for easy readability.
