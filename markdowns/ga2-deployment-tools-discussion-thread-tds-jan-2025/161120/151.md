Try these [@21f3000745](/u/21f3000745)

1. Download the data file once again and replace it with your current file, then deploy.  
   **If this doesnâ€™t work, then:**
2. Try clicking on Check button once again. There are few cases where due to duplicity or other problems in the data, this bug occurs. The next check will most probably work.
3. Reload the page, open the Networks Tab in the Inspect menu, click on Fetch/XHR filter button. Next click on check, if this error prompts up, you will get the request the system sent to check your answer. Copy that request and check on localhost.
