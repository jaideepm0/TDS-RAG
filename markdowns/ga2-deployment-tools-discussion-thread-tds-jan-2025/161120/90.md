Nothing unethical about using codespaces and public ports. You solved it. Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant. There is more than one way to skin a cat.

That being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a “scientist”, its fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the “spirit of your question”.

Most of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic essentials!

So we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done.

In the meanwhile:

# Image Description

The image titled **"PORTS EXPLAINED"** features a technical theme with vibrant green and blue colors. 

## Elements

- **Title**: The top section prominently displays the words **"PORTS EXPLAINED"** in large white and green font.
  
- **Table**:
  - On the left side, there is a vertical list of network protocols, each associated with a port number.
  - Protocols listed include:
    - FTP: 21
    - SSH: 22
    - TELNET: 23
    - SMTP: 25
    - DNS: 53
    - (and more, up to RDP: 3389)
  
- **Server Graphics**:
  - On the right side, there is an illustration of a server rack with various indicators.
  - Green lights and indicators show data metrics like IP addresses, fan RPM, and temperature, suggesting a monitoring system.

- **Monitor Graphic**: 
  - At the bottom left, there's an image of a computer monitor displaying a green screen, suggesting it's a part of a network setup.

- **Animation Note**: A label indicates the content is **"ANIMATED,"** implying that these elements relate to a dynamic presentation or video on network ports.

# Image Description

The image features a colorful graphic with a gradient background transitioning from blue to green. 

- **Text**: The word "FIREWALL" is prominently displayed at the top in bold white letters. Below it, the word "EXPLAINED" is also in white, slightly smaller.
- **Visual Elements**: 
  - On the right side, there is a large depiction of a red brick wall labeled "FIREWALL."
  - To the left, a black silhouette of a figure wearing a hat is shown, associated with a computer. 
  - The computer screen displays green and blue data patterns.
  - In front of the computer, there are three red skull icons with crossbones, suggesting a threat.

The overall theme conveys a discussion about firewalls and cybersecurity.

# Image Description

The image is a digital graphic comparing "VMs" (Virtual Machines) and "Containers." 

## Key Elements:

- **Background Gradient**: A smooth gradient transitioning from green to blue.
  
- **Text**: 
  - The words "VMs" and "CONTAINERS" are prominently displayed in large, bold white font.
  - The phrase "vs" is smaller and centered between "VMs" and "CONTAINERS."
  - The word "ANIMATED" is located at the bottom in a slightly smaller font.

- **Visual Elements**: 
  - To the left, there are several panels labeled with terms such as "EMAIL," "WEBSERVER," "DATABASE," and "VIRTUAL MACHINES," showcasing a virtual machine setup.
  - To the right, there is a large panel labeled "CONTAINERS," featuring multiple application labels, showcasing a container setup.

- **Computer Icon**: A desktop computer with a keyboard is depicted at the bottom left, adding context to the theme of computing.

Overall, the image visually contrasts virtual machines with containers, emphasizing their functionalities in computing environments.

There are other great videos on the above channel, but these are probably the most relevant for us. Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything.
