[@22f2001640](/u/22f2001640) in that case

* a firewall or local security settings might block access to port 8080, or
* a network restriction is blocking access to port 8080

Please try one of these:

* Try the same on a personal laptop on a public / home network
* GitHub codespaces, as [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) suggested

You *could* try an ngrok alternative like [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/) but I don’t think that’ll work.
