Hello Sir,

I’ve been working on question 6 and I’m facing this error where the marks are not ordered properly. I believe my code appends the marks based on the names that are inputted in the backend but I’m unable to identify the source of this issue. Please shed some light on the same.  

```markdown
## Image Description

- **Background Color**: Dark theme.
- **Text Content**:
  - A message emphasizing the need to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow GET requests from any source.
  - A prompt asking for the correct Vercel URL format, illustrated with an example: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`.
  - A filled example URL: `https://new1-ivory.vercel.app/api`.
  - An error message indicating a mismatch: 
    - **Expected**: `[73, 73, 53, 63, 61]`
    - **But got**: `[73, 53, 61, 63, 73]`
```

Thanks and Regards  
Shalini
