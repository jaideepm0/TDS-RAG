Actually even on the portal it’s showing like this:  

```markdown
# Image Description

The image shows a webpage from an online exam platform. 

## Key Features:
- **Title:** "Ended at Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST"
- **Header Sections:**
  - A red banner indicating the end time of the exam.
  - A reminder about the time required for the assignment, suggesting it may take over 2 hours.
- **User Information:** Displays that the user is logged in with a specific ID.
- **Recent Saves:** Lists saves made on various dates, showing a score of 6.5 each time, with options to reload.
- **Questions Section:** Placeholder for questions related to the exam. 
- **Discussion Link:** An invitation to join a discussion on Discourse.

## Additional Information:
- The webpage footer encourages user interaction and contains options related to saving progress.
```

  
So it’s confusing.
