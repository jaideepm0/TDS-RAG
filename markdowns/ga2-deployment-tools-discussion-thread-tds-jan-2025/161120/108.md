## Image Description

The image displays a code snippet from a programming environment, likely a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. 

### Key Components:

- **Imports:**
  - `numpy` as `np`
  - `Image` from `PIL`
  - `files` from `google.colab`
  - `colorsys`
  
- **Code Functionality:**
  - It begins by uploading a file.
  - An image is opened and converted to an RGB array normalized to the range [0, 1].
  - The lightness of the pixels is calculated using the HLS color space.
  - A count of pixels with lightness greater than 0.219 is printed.

### File Information:

- **File Name:** `lenna.webp`
- **File Type:** image/webp
- **File Size:** 14820 bytes
- **Last Modified:** 1/30/2025
- **Upload Status:** 100% done
