# Image Description

The image displays a coding session in an integrated development environment (IDE). 

## Key Features:

- **Code Snippet**: 
  - The code is primarily written in Python and utilizes the FastAPI framework.
  - It includes the following lines:
    - `allow_credentials=True`
    - `allow_methods=["*"]`
    - `allow_headers=["*"]`
    - `data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")`
    - An asynchronous function definition using `@app.get("/api")` to handle requests.

- **User Interface**: 
  - The IDE background is dark, featuring syntax highlighting for Python code.
  - Various icons for features like run, debug, and files are visible at the top.

- **Presentation Context**:
  - A panel on the right indicates that a user named "Saransh" is presenting.
  - There are options visible for video call features at the bottom of the screen.

- **Date and Time**: 
  - The timestamp at the top shows "10:31 PM Fri, Jan 31."

Overall, the image captures a technical demonstration or coding session focused on building an API with FastAPI and handling data from a CSV file.
