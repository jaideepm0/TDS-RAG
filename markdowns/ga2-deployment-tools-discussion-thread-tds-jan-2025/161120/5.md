## Image Description

The image shows a user interface for a web application. 

- **Text Prompt:** "What is the Vercel URL? It should look like: https://your-app.vercel.app/api"
- **Input Field:** Displays a URL: `https://markdarshan.vercel.app/api`
- **Error Message:** "TypeError: Failed to fetch" appears in a red-colored text.

The background is dark, likely indicating a dark mode theme for the application interface.
```
