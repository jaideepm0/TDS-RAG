This must be a production deployment url, that’s why I am not able to access it.

```markdown
# Image Description

The image displays a webpage with a dark background. In the center, there is a message stating:

## Team Access Required
You are signed in as **jivraj-18**.

Below this, the text indicates that access to the unique deployment URL is restricted because the user is not a team member. There is a prompt for the user to log in with a different Vercel account.

At the top of the page, there's a colorful circular graphic.
```

Solution :

Go to vercel dashboard and select your project, and below domains you would find a url use that.

```markdown
# Production Deployment
