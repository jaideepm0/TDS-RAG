## Create a GitHub Action
Follow these instructions to create a GitHub action in one of your GitHub repositories. Ensure that one of the steps in the action contains your email address. For example:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    steps:
      - name: 23f3001259@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
        run: echo "Hello, World!"
```

- **Trigger the action** and ensure it is the **most recent action**.

## Repository URL
What is your repository URL? It will look like:
```
https://github.com/USER/REPO
```

- Example repository URL:
```
https://github.com/divya23f3001255/divya.github.io
```

**Error:** No step matches 23f3001259@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
```

  
can anyone please explain what’s the error and how to correct it ?
