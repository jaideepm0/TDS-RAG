[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) Hello Sir, I’m also using Squoosh. The pixel size of the resulting image is 800 x 600 and the file size is 1,473 bytes. The steps I used to create the solution image:

1. Open Squoosh and load the image
2. In the dropdown in “Compress” section, select “OxiPNG”. Left the other options unchanged (Interlace checkbox is unchecked, Effort is at 2).
3. The resulting image is downloaded which has same pixel size as original image but file size is 1,473 bytes

```markdown
# Image Description

The image displays a user interface for an image editing tool. The background is dark gray, while the panel is styled in blue and white tones.

## Features:
- **Edit Section:**
  - **Resize:** Toggle switch (off position).
  - **Reduce palette:** Toggle switch (off position).

- **Compress Section:**
  - **Compression Option:** Dropdown labeled "OxiPNG."
  - **Interlace:** Checkbox option (not checked).
  - **Effort Slider:** A slider labeled "Effort" with a current value of 2.

- **Compression Status:**
  - **Compression Rate:** Displayed as "63%."
  - **File Size:** Indicated as "1.41 kB."
  - **Download Button:** A blue button with a downward arrow icon, suggesting a download action.
```

I also tried WebP with “Lossless” option selected and “Effort” increased to 9. This gives even smaller filesize at just 630 bytes. However, even that image is not accepted. The selected options for WebP are in the screenshot below.
