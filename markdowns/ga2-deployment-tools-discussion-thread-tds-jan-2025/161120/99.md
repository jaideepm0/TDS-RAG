Sir I am facing some err in Q10 of GA2,  
Kindly look at the error :

```
Error: Response is not valid JSON: <!DOCTYPE html> <!--[if lt IE 7]> <html class="no-js ie6 oldie" lang="en-US"> <```markdown
## Image Description

The image contains a screenshot of a coding environment or text editor featuring instructions related to downloading and running a specific model called "Llamafile." 

### Key Elements:
- **Text Instructions:**
  - A prompt to download the Llamafile model.
  - Steps to create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using a tool called `ngrok`.
  - A reference to an `ngrok` URL, which is indicated as an example of its format.

### Layout:
- The text is displayed in a dark-themed interface, typical of many development environments.
- There is a highlighted or emphasized URL at the bottom, which appears to be generated by `ngrok` for remote access.

### Context:
- The instructions suggest a focus on machine learning or server setup using specific models and tunneling software.
