While I understand why you might choose to use `flask` due to your familiarity with it,  
the `http.server` library is just very simple to use.

The **only extra line of code** you would need inside your `get` request if you used the `http.server` library would be:

`self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")`

Try to rewrite your code using `http.server` library so that your debugging for simple tasks like this is easy.

The boilerplate code for a `get` request using the `http.server` library was already given in Q6. So you have to do very minimal modifications to it and it works like a charm.

Kind regards
