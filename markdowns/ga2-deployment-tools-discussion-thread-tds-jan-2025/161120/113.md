For Graded Assignment 2 Q6, Iâ€™m getting the right answer but in portal it throws an error.  

```markdown
# Image Description

The image shows a screenshot of a web browser with several tabs open at the top. The titles of the tabs include "IIT Madras," "Graded Assignment," "TDS 2025 Jan," and "GA2 - Deploy." 

In the main browser window, there is a JSON response displayed that reads:

```json
{"marks":[65]}
```

A "Pretty-print" checkbox is visible, possibly indicating an option to format the JSON output for better readability. The background of the browser interface is standard for common web browsers.
```

  

# Image Description

The image contains instructions and information related to deploying a Python app to Vercel. Key points include:

- A prompt to download a JSON file named `q-vercel-python.json`, which contains the marks of 100 imaginary students.
- Instructions to create and deploy a Python app to Vercel, focusing on exposing an API that responds with marks when a specific request URL is made.
- An example response in JSON format showing marks for two names, X and Y:
  ```json
  {
    "marks": [10, 20]
  }
  ```
- A note emphasizing the need to enable CORS to allow GET requests from any origin.
- A specified format for the Vercel URL, with an example URL provided that looks like:
  `https://vercelapp-mvqtg2t29-sri-balajis-projects-ec088a33.vercel.app/api`
- An error message at the bottom: `TypeError: Failed to fetch`.

This is my vercel deployment
