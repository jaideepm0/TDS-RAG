I am facing this issue. It is stating the error as mentioned  

```markdown
## Image Description

The image contains a coding interface that is displaying an API documentation or code snippet concerning a query parameter named `class`. 

### Key Features:
- **Error Message**: An error response indicates an issue with retrieving student data based on specified classes.
- **API Endpoint**: A suggested API endpoint is displayed, which is `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`.
- **Request Format**: The request should include a query parameter `class` to filter results based on student classes.
- **JSON Output**: The response includes a list of student objects with properties like `studentId`, `class`, and other relevant details.

### Notes:
- There's a mention of enabling CORS to allow GET requests from any origin.
- The output suggests a discrepancy in data returned versus what is expected for the specified classes.
```

The /api is working perfectly fine manually either I specify the class or without it  

```markdown
# JSON Data Display

The image shows a JSON representation of student data in a structured format. The main elements include:

- **Students Array**: A list containing multiple objects, each representing a student.
- **Student Properties**:
  - `studentId`: A unique identifier for each student.
  - `class`: The class or group to which the student belongs.

### Example Entries:
- `{"studentId":1, "class":"10"}`
- `{"studentId":2, "class":"7K"}`
- `{"studentId":3, "class":"2G"}`

This format is commonly used for data interchange, making it easily consumable by APIs and applications for further processing or display.
```

Sample class example that I tried manually is below  

```markdown
## Image Description

The image displays a code snippet in a dark-themed code editor. The code appears to be a JSON object representing student data. Each student entry includes an `id` and a `class`. 

### Content Breakdown:
- The JSON structure contains an array of student objects.
- Each object has the following elements:
  - `studentId`: A unique identifier for each student.
  - `class`: A string representing the student's class.
  
### Example Entries:
- `{ "studentId": 0, "class": "9th" }`
- `{ "studentId": 1, "class": "10th" }`
- `{ "studentId": 2, "class": "11th" }`

### Environment:
- The image is viewed in a browser window with multiple tabs open.
- The tab titles suggest that it is integrated with programming and development tools.
```

The main code is below

```
import sys


sys.path.append("C:\\Users\\Deveshu Pathak\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.12_qbz5n2kfra8p0\\LocalCache\\local-packages\\Python312\\Scripts")
# tds_q9.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, Query
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
import pandas as pd

app = FastAPI()

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],  
    allow_headers=["*"],  
)

# Load CSV file
df = pd.read_csv("q-fastapi.csv")

@app.get("/api")
def get_students(class_: list[str] = Query(None, alias="class")):
    if class_:
        filtered_df = df[df["class"].isin(class_)]
    else:
        filtered_df = df

    # Convert to dictionary list
    students = filtered_df.to_dict(orient="records")
    return {"students": students}
