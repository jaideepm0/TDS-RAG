Hi Mishkat,

The GA url encoded parameter is `class`  
In your screenshot, you are using `class_`  
Your code that we examined earlier also accepts `class_` as the parameter instead of `class` as required by the GA  
The GA will test your deployment by sending it a request with the url encoded parameter `class`
