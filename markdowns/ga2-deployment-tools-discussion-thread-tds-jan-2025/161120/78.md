Regarding question no. 9 Web Framework: FastAPI. I got the following error for the answer to the question  

```markdown
## Image Description

The image displays a screenshot of a programming or API documentation interface. It contains text related to retrieving data for students based on specific query parameters. Key points include:

- A description of how to structure an API URL with a query parameter (e.g., `/api/classes/1A`).
- An example that shows how different classes can be filtered by modifying the URL.
- A note about enabling CORS for GET requests.
- A suggested API URL format: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`.
- An error message at the bottom indicating that the response undefined does not match the expected format for various students.

The screen shows code snippets in a red highlighted area for emphasis, and portions of the text are formatted in a way typical of programming environments.
```

  
But when I run the url in my browser I got the following response  

```markdown
## JSON Data Overview

The image displays a JSON-like string containing a list of student records. Each record includes the following fields:

- `studentId`: Unique identifier for the student.
- `class`: The class to which the student belongs.

### Sample Data

Below are some examples from the data:

```json
[
    {"studentId": 67, "class": "CK"},
    {"studentId": 68, "class": "ST"},
    {"studentId": 99, "class": "ST"},
    {"studentId": 108, "class": "ST"},
    {"studentId": 237, "class": "K7"},
    {"studentId": 240, "class": "CK"},
    {"studentId": 180, "class": "ST"},
    {"studentId": 207, "class": "ST"},
    {"studentId": 174, "class": "8K"},
    {"studentId": 11, "class": "ST"}
]
```

### Note

The data appears to be formatted for API responses, indicating a possible interaction with a backend system, where multiple student records can be retrieved based on certain query parameters.
```

  
I have checked both the expected result from the assignment and result from direct running of url both are same. I donâ€™t find any difference.  
[@carlton](/u/carlton) can you clarify where went wrong
