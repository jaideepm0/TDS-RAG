In the ngrok question I was getting that same json error as everybody else since last 7 days or so. The ngrok link was working fine in browser every time but. Today i ran the LLama file with `--n-gpu-layers 35` parameter at the end which makes it run using my laptops graphics card i guess. After i ran LLama file using this and ngrok later, my link was accepted in the GA 2 and i did not get any error after that.  
[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) did this happen because i ran LLama file using my laptop GPU? This was suggested to me by another student who had the same problem.
