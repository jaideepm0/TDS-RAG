If I entered the URL I get the error Failed to fetch  

```markdown
## Image Description

The image consists of a screenshot displaying instructions related to a programming task. 

1. **Download Link**:
   - There is a download link for a JSON file named `vercel-python.json`, which contains the marks of 100 imaginary students.

2. **Task Description**:
   - Instructions to create and deploy a Python app on Vercel.
   - The app should expose an API that returns a JSON response with student marks based on a request format: 
     ```
     https://your-app.vercel.app/api/name-X
     ```

3. **CORS Requirement**:
   - It emphasizes the need to enable CORS to allow GET requests from any origin.

4. **Vercel URL Example**:
   - A sample Vercel URL format is shown: 
     ```
     https://your-app.vercel.app/api
     ```

5. **Error Message**:
   - At the bottom, there is a text box showing an error message: "Typeerror: failed to fetch," indicating a potential issue with fetching data.

Overall, the content is focused on setting up an API in Python and deploying it on Vercel, with instructions and examples clearly detailed.
```

If I run the same in my browser, I get the output (just I tried for two name available in json file)  

```markdown
# Image Description

The image shows a web browser window displaying a coding environment. The following features are visible:

- The address bar at the top contains a URL indicating a deployed project on Vercel.
- There are multiple open tabs, including "My Dashboard," "Graded Assign," and others.
- The main content area shows a code snippet with the following:
  - A Python function call, `pretty.print()`.
  - A dictionary declaration: `{"mark": [5, 4]}`.
  - Some minimalistic formatting present in the code output.

The layout suggests usage of an integrated development environment (IDE) for coding or web development.
```

Kindly help me to fix the issue
