Hi Team ,

For GA - 2 , Question 6:  
I am done with the code, deployed same on vercel.  
And It is working fine gives correct json response as expected in browser.

But When I try to that on portal It gives me “CORS Missing Allow Origin” Error.  

# Image Description

The image displays a web development interface, likely within a browser's Developer Tools. Key features include:

- **Download Link**: A link to download a JSON file named `grades.pyhon.json`, which contains the marks of 100 imaginary students.
- **API Creation Instructions**: Steps to create and deploy a Python app to Vercel. It mentions exposing an API that responds to requests with JSON data based on student names.
- **Example API URL**: A suggested format for the Vercel URL, which appears to be a placeholder related to accessing the API.
- **Console Output**: The bottom portion shows network request details, including various HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`) and their respective responses with status codes. The response includes various data attributes, indicating the success or failure of requests.

Overall, the image provides insights into API development using Vercel and JSON data management.

I have added “Access-Control-Allow-Origin” as “\*” for allowing request from any origin.

I get the correct response in browser but it fails in quiz portal.  
Can anyone please suggest what exactly I am missing here.

Thanks
