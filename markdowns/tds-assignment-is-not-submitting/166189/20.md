Scores for GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5, Project1, Project2, ROE will NOT be inside your seek portal.

The scores will only be visible in the dashboard. Just ignore anything inside the seek portal.

As stated in multiple places in discourse as well as in live sessions, The final score is always your last submission.

Kind regards
