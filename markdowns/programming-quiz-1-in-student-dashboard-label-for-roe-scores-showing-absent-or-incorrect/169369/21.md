24F1001631 here. It is also showing absent for me. I had submitted before the time limit and also after the time limit after hacking it(wasnâ€™t sure if it was allowed but decided to try it nevertheless)

I feel I should atleast receive the marks for which I had submitted within the time limit.

My roll number is 24F1001631.
