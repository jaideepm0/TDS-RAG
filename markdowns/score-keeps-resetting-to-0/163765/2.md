Hi Shalini,

We are aware of the issue and [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) is working on a solution. The temporary fix is to just reenter all the answers before hitting the Save button. Thanks for the reminder, please bear with the inconvenience while its being fixed.

**The last submission is always saved. So please make sure that your last submission contains all the answers for all the questions.**

Kind regards
