Sorry for the late upload but as you can see in the screenshot i had submitted answers for TDS Week 2 graded assignment but it shows 0 both here and in current courses tab.  
I did reload the recent tab before uploading and for tds ga submission i submit and keep the tab open until the timer runs out.
