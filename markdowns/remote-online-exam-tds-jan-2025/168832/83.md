Hi [@23f2004781](/u/23f2004781)

I looked for your submissions in backend and can’t find any submission.

> There was no network issue, as other applications were working fine. However, the moment I clicked “Save,” all websites stopped loading, and my browser became unresponsive.

There was a technical support meeting going between 1 Pm to 1:50 pm on ROE day, you were expected to join that meeting. You didn’t join technical support meet before deadline.

### Image Description

The image features a dark background with a highlighted text box. Inside the box, there are two main pieces of information presented in a friendly format:

1. **Questions Section:**
   - Text: "Have questions? Join Discourse (IITM students only)."
   - This section encourages students to join a platform for inquiries.

2. **Technical Issues Section:**
   - Text: "Technical issues? OPTIONAL: Join Google Meet (IITM students only)."
   - This provides an option for students to seek help with technical problems via another platform.

The text is in a light blue color, making it stand out against the darker background.
```

Even on discourse we were continuously looking for new posts during ROE, you created discourse post at 2:3 PM which was after deadline so we can’t help with it.
