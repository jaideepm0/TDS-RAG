I have attempted all the questions in the ROE and solved few of the questions but i forgot to save the submission. At that time, I did not realize that I have not even saved once during the time. After realizing that i have not saved it in the evening, I have used the console to disable the save and saved my answers. Is it possible to validate it? I donâ€™t have any submissions before 1:45pm. I realize that it is my mistake for not being careful about it but i request sir to be lenient about it as the project 1 was also difficult and i have my exams tomorrow.
