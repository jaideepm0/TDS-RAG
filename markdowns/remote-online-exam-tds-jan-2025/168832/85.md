Hi [@Jayeshbansal](/u/jayeshbansal)

Until not clicked on save button answers getâ€™s checked at frontend side only. There is no way we can validate it after deadline.

I trust you would have solved few questions and also would have checked before deadline but clicking on save button was must to get submission evaluated.

Kind regards
