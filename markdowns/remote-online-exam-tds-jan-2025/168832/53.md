# Image Description

The image showcases a dual-screen setup displaying two different applications.

## Left Side:
- **Application**: A web-based coding platform or exam interface.
- **Content**:
  - A task description is visible, instructing to write a FastAPI proxy server that serves data from a given URL while also adding a CORS header (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`) to the responses.
  - There is a countdown timer at the top indicating 26 minutes and 36 seconds remaining.
  - A red error message states: "Error: Incorrect response" with a prompt for the user to input their FastAPI proxy URL endpoint.

## Right Side:
- **Application**: An API testing tool (possibly Postman).
- **Content**:
  - A GET request is being configured with a specified URL (`http://127.0.0.1:8000`).
  - Below it, there are sections for query parameters and response details.
  - A status line indicates a "200 OK" response with size and time taken for the request.
  - The output shows a portion of the API response, including HTML and JSON elements.

### Additional Elements:
- The status bar at the bottom indicates various activities and logs from the API tool.
- The interface includes settings for sending requests, checking responses, and managing collections.")

  
[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) Sir, can you please tell me why this was not accepted? here is my code:

```
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
import httpx
import uvicorn

app = FastAPI()

# Add CORS middleware to handle preflight OPTIONS requests
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

@app.get("/api")
async def proxy(url: str, request: Request):
    headers = {key: value for key, value in request.headers.items() if key.lower() != "host"}
    try:
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.get(url, headers=headers)
            return response.text
    except httpx.RequestError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Request failed: {str(e)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)

```

here are the responses:

```
INFO:     127.0.0.1:51793 - "OPTIONS /api?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhttpbin.org%2Fget%3Fx%3D87738 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
INFO:     127.0.0.1:51793 - "GET /api?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhttpbin.org%2Fget%3Fx%3D87738 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK

```
