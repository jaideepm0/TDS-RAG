# Image Description

The image displays a web page with the following features:

- **Header Section**: 
  - Displays a message indicating that an exam ended on **Sunday, 2 March 2025, at 1:45 PM IST**. 
  - Contains a score indicating **0**.
  - Includes a button labeled **Check a report**.
  - Has a 'Login' button beneath the header.

- **Main Section**:
  - A dark-themed panel labeled **Recent saves** with the note that the most recent entry is the official score.
  - Features three buttons labeled **Reload** next to time stamps and scores:
    - **Entry 1**: from **3/2/2025, 1:41:37 PM**, Score: **10**
    - **Entry 2**: from **3/2/2025, 1:41:37 PM**, Score: **10**
    - **Entry 3**: from **3/2/2025, 1:41:33 PM**, Score: **10**
```

  
Sir, Iâ€™m facing the same issue. While the recent scores say I have a score of 10, my final score shows 0. Kindly look into this, and please consider the highest marks from recent saves.  
Thank you.
