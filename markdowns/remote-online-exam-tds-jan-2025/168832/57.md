Hello Sir"s, [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)

I was able to successfully attempt only 5 questions within the time limit. But due to internet issues, I could not submit exactly at 1:45pm.  
My last submission was at 1:47pm. But if there was a auto save then you could already check my answers were in the portal.

I request you to please consider submission delays of 2-3 mins as this was due a technical glitches. And we too are switching tabs and running in vscode

### Image Description

The image displays a portion of a user interface, highlighting a section titled "Recent saves" in a bold, dark font. Below the title, there is a button labeled "Reload" in a light blue box with blue text. Additionally, there is a timestamp indicated as "from 3/2/2025, 1:47:43 PM." The background of the image appears to be a light green color.

Kind Regards,  
Muthu
