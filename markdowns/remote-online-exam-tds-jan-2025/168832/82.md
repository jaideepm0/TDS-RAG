When I clicked the save button, it took an unusually long time to respond and eventually showed an error. There was no network issue, as other applications were working fine. However, the moment I clicked “Save,” all websites stopped loading, and my browser became unresponsive. I’m not sure what caused this problem, but I will share a screenshot to help diagnose the issue.
