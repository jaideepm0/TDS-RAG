- A `curl` command is shown, which is used to make a POST request to a specified API URL: 
  - `https://yantravid-git-main-vicky-kumars-projects-5400c012.vercel.app/api/`
- The command includes a form parameter with the question: "What is 2+2?"
- The server's response is displayed as a JSON object: `{"answer":"4"}`

The overall context implies an interaction with a web API to solve a simple arithmetic question.
