Dear Learner,

Please do not ignore this important announcement. We are still doing some checks on the server endpoints for your TDS Project 2.

If you have turned it off because you were told that evaluations were complete, **please turn them back on.**

We apologise for the inconvenience caused. We aim to complete the evaluations as soon as possible and are cognizant that some of you are using up credits on Azure and other platforms to keep them up and running.

We will inform you in subsequent emails when your evaluation is complete so that you do not have to keep them up and running longer than necessary.

Kind regards,  
TDS Team

regarding an issue with my submission.

I believe the issue may have occurred because I had mistakenly provided an incorrect API endpoint in my earlier submission. However, my server is still actively running on Vercel  
<https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app>  
and the correct API endpoint is:

correct api : <https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app/api/>

Everything else in the project is functioning as expected. I kindly request you to re-evaluate my submission using the correct endpoint as i am currently in my 3rd year of BTech Chemical engineering at NIT Allahabad and my placement session is coming so i donâ€™t want to get failed in this course due to such a small mistake.

Thank you for your understanding and support.
