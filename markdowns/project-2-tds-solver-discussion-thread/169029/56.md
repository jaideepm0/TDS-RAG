> You do not need to do the task as the GA required.

Does this mean this type of question won’t be paramaterized?

```markdown
**Instructions for Visual Studio Code**

1. Install and run Visual Studio Code.
2. Open your Terminal (or Command Prompt).
3. Type `code -s` and press Enter.
4. Copy and paste the **entire output** below the question.

**Question:** What is the output of `code -s`?
```

Like instead of `code -s` there won’t be any other command, otherwise it would require installation of VS Code inside a container to find the answer or this type of questions won’t be part of evaluation at all?

The same confusion is for these type of questions as well:  

```markdown
## Image Description

The image displays a computer screen interface containing two segments for writing formulas in Google Sheets and Excel. Each segment provides an example formula and a note about its compatibility with the software. 

### Segment 1: Google Sheets
- **Formula:** 
  ```
  =SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 15, 6), 1, 10))
  ```
- **Note:** This formula will not work in Excel.
- **Prompt:** "What is the result?"

### Segment 2: Excel
- **Formula:** 
  ```
  =SUM(TAKE(SORTBY({3,14,16,10,3,12,15,4,11,11,14,14}, {10,9,13,2,11,8,16,14,7,15,5,4,6,1,3,12}), 1, 9))
  ```
- **Note:** This formula will only work in Office 365.
- **Prompt:** "What is the result?"
- **Additional Note:** If you get `#NAME?`, you have the wrong version of Excel. Find a friend for whom this works.

### Buttons
- Two "Check" buttons are provided at the bottom of each segment for submitting answers.
```

A bit more clarity would be helpful. Thanks in advance.
