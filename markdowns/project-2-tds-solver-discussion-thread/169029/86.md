# Image Description

The image appears to be a screenshot of a webpage or a code editor. 

**Content:**
- It includes instructions on how to publish a page using GitHub Pages. 
- Emphasis is placed on ensuring the email address `22f3000819ed5.study.iitm.ac.in` is present in the page's HTML.
- There is a note that GitHub Pages are served via CloudFlare, which obfuscates emails, and users are advised to wrap their email address within a specific comment tag in HTML.
- The tag shown is `<!-- email_off -->`.
- A question is included, asking, "What is the GitHub Pages URL?" with a URL template example like `https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]`.
- Further instructions suggest adding parameters `?v=1` or `?v=2` to the URL to bust the cache if recent changes are not reflected.
- There is a button labeled "Check".
  
**Layout:**
- The text is presented in a clear, instructional format with a focus on coding and website deployment guidelines.
- There is a reference to using Google Colab, potentially indicating a solution or tool for coding tasks. 

**Visual elements:**
- The overall design appears to be mobile-friendly, with a simple layout typical of instructional websites or coding platforms.

For questions like this (there’s a similar one in GA1 too, will the user send the USER and REPO of their GitHub account as parameters too?  
Even if they do, my script may not get necessary authentication to create repo and make commit in their repository. In this case, would I have to implement GitHub OAuth flow?  
If they don’t send those details but just the email and I am expected to just change the email in my own repo and commit, in the worst case making the same change repeatedly may be misconstrued as a DDoS attack by an automated script which may lead to my GitHub account being suspended, which does not seem ideal.  
Can you please at least hint at a solution?

Edit: Same query for the GitHub actions question (GA2 Q7)

Another edit: A similar query for GA2 Q8. Repeated dockerimage pushes to Dockerhub with different tags.
