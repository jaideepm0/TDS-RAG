Sir, in GA4 Question 7, the portal gives the boundary of ultra-new user as the exact time when it was opened, right?  

# Image Description

The image contains a text-based interface with several bullet points and a prompt for user input. Below is a structured summary:

## Bullet Points:
- **Competitive Intelligence:** Focus on staying updated with emerging trends within local developer communities to improve talent acquisition strategies.
- **Efficiency:** Highlights the importance of automating data collection to allow recruiters to engage more effectively and build relationships.
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Emphasizes leveraging standardized and reliable data for strategic business decisions in recruitment and market research.

## Input Prompt:
- A prompt for entering a date in ISO 8601 format (e.g., `2024-01-01T00:00:00Z`) regarding when the newest user joined GitHub.
  
## Additional Instructions:
- A note indicating how to search using specific filters like `location:` and `followers:`, with specific sorting instructions provided.

## Timestamp:
- **Date and Time:** 3/30/2025, 7:21:18 PM.

  
So, will this boundary for ultra-new user be sent as parameter in the question or can my app use datetime.now() to set the ultra-new user boundary?
