[@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  
Sir, I saw from the logs on Cloud Run that my project was probably evaluated on 5th April at around 11:51 PM and all the requests made during that time resulted in 3 response status codes: 302, 307 and 405 by no fault of my app, but rather errors in the request itself. I mentioned the exactly correct URL of my app in the form but the evaluation logs show three different types of URL to which request was made. As I mentioned in the form, my url is of the format “https://…/api/” and allows only POST requests.

1. The app was supposed to allow POST requests and I allowed only POST requests, so GET requests even to correct url resulted in 405 response
2. When POST requests were actually made, two wrong urls were used for all the POST requests  
   a. http://…/api/ → resulted in 302 response  
   b. https://…/api → resulted in a 307  
   whereas the url I gave was of the format “https://…/api/”

The logs from Cloud Run

# Log File Summary

This image displays a log of HTTP requests and responses from a web application. The log entries include timestamps, IP addresses, request methods, status codes, and additional information about the requests.

## Key Information

- **Date and Time:** The log entries date from April 5, 2023.
- **IP Addresses:** The requests originate from IP address `169.254.169.126`.
- **Request Methods:** Multiple HTTP methods are used including `POST`, `GET`, and `INFO`.
- **Status Codes:** 
  - `307` - Temporary Redirect
  - `405` - Method Not Allowed
  - `200` - OK
  - `302` - Found (Redirect)
- **Requests to API:** Most requests are directed to `/api`, with different outcomes based on the method used.

## Observations

- There are multiple instances of "Method Not Allowed" errors indicating that certain HTTP methods are not permitted for the requested endpoints.
- Several redirects were executed as indicated by the `307` and `302` status codes.
- The final entry shows a successful `GET` request with a `200` status code.

This log provides insights into the interactions with the web application and highlights areas requiring further examination, particularly around the handling of different HTTP methods.
```

As you can see from the above logs, all POST requests made to my app have the wrong url, some have only http and some end with “/api” instead of “/api/”, both of which do not match with the correct url I gave in the Google Form (screenshot attached below).
