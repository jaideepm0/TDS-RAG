Hi [@23f2000573](/u/23f2000573)

Files will be exactly same as GA assignment, if there is url then it will be a url and if it get’s downloaded by clicking then it will come from requester’s machine.

> so, can I assume that the table will be given as a html element in the “question” attribute and the image in the “file” attribute?

For questions that have table they will either come as html code or as markdown. Keep a if else condition for identifying which case it is, if it’s a html then beautiful soup should be able to find table tag, if it’s markdown table then it can be identified with `|` characters.

Kind regards
