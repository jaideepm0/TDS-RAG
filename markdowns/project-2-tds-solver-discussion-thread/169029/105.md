## Image Description

The image displays a code snippet written in Python. The code is designed to authenticate a user in Google Colab and access their email information. 

### Key Components:

1. **Imports**:
   - `hashlib`
   - `requests`
   - `google.colab.auth`
   - `oauth2client.client.GoogleCredentials`

2. **Authentication**:
   - The code uses `auth.authenticate_user()` to authenticate the user.
   - It retrieves application credentials with `creds = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()`.

3. **API Request**:
   - It sends a request to obtain user information from the Google APIs using the user's access token.
   - The request is made to the endpoint `https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/userinfo`.

4. **Email Extraction**:
   - The email of the authenticated user is extracted from the response.
   - A SHA-256 hash is calculated from the email and token expiry year, and the last five characters of the hash are obtained.

### Final Output:
At the bottom, a prompt asks, "What is the result? (It should be a 5-character string)."
```
