Respected Sir,

I kindly request a deadline extension of at least 3 minutes for the project submission, similar to what was done for ROE. Due to slow internet connectivity and the absence of WiFi, my submission took longer than usual. As a result, I was only able to upload it at 12:01 AM instead of the regular 11:59 PM deadline.  
PLEASE Sir, As Iâ€™m a standalone student and this is my primary degree after 12th, please do accept it.

Thank you

### Image Description

The image features an animated black cat character, depicted in a cartoon style. The cat is on its knees with its paws clasped together in a pleading gesture. It has a serious expression, with closed eyes and a slightly furrowed brow. The character's body is primarily black with a lighter grayish patch on its belly. The background shows a soft, colorful landscape, including trees and a gentle sky, contributing to a lighthearted atmosphere.
