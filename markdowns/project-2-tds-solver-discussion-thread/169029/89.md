You won’t be required to update someone else’s repo.  
Any github name, repo name is fine.  
Just that it should have github pages with that particular email address.

Same for GA2 Quetion7 as well, you github url is required.

> If they don’t send those details but just the email and I am expected to just change the email in my own repo and commit, in the worst case making the same change repeatedly may be misconstrued as a DDoS attack by an automated script which may lead to my GitHub account being suspended, which does not seem ideal.

In evaluation we will only send request one worst case twice or thrice if it fails from our end, so no issues with that.
