> Like instead of `code -s` there won’t be any other command, otherwise it would require installation of VS Code inside a container to find the answer or this type of questions won’t be part of evaluation at all?

there will not be any other command. This question can be solved with a hardcoded answer

Excel and Google sheet questions can be solved by just using python . No excel or google sheets required.

The question WILL be parameterised however. So the numbers might be different. You should just understand what the question is asking and solve it programatically to get the answer.
