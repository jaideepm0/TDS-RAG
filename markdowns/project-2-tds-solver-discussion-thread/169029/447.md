Humble Request to Update API Request Link
-----------------------------------------

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to kindly ask if it would be possible to update my API request link for project 2 in TDS. I realized that I mistakenly used the wrong endpoint in my earlier request.

**Previous API Request Link:**

## Image Description

The image features a circular logo with a teal background. In the center, there is a stylized lightning bolt depicted in white. The lightning bolt is designed with two angular shapes, creating a dynamic and modern appearance.

### [IITM Assignment API - Swagger UI](https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/docs)

**Correct API Request Link:**  
<https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/>  
<https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/>

Would it be possible for you to allow me to make this change, or kindly update the link on my behalf? I sincerely apologize for the confusion, and I’d be truly grateful for your support and understanding.

Thank you so much for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,  
Pratyush Pulak Nishhank
