#### Please extend the deadline for TDS Project 2. The MAD 1 project and two OPPEs have taken up all my time. I have completed my TDS project up to the Week 3 assignment solutions, and only two weeks remain to complete Weeks 4 and 5.

# Image Description

The image features a cartoon-style character with a boyish appearance. He has short black hair and is portrayed with large, expressive eyes that convey a sense of yearning or desperation. The character has rosy cheeks and is seen with his hands clasped together in a pleading gesture. 

To the right of the character, the word "PLEASE!" is written in a bold, pink font, emphasizing the character's appeal. The background is black, which contrasts with the character and the text, drawing attention to them.
