Hi [@23f2003751](/u/23f2003751)

### Short Answer: No

### Long Answer:

Backslashes are usually not a problem when converting a string to JSON. But somehow the evaluation script isn’t taking this into consideration. Check this out.  
This is my response  

```markdown
## Image Description

The image displays a snippet of sorted JSON data in a code-like format. 

### Key Features:
- **Data Structure**: The JSON array contains three objects, each representing a person with their name and age.
  - **Object 1**: 
    - `name`: "Bob"
    - `age`: 11
  - **Object 2**: 
    - `name`: "Emma"
    - `age`: 11
  - **Object 3**: 
    - `name`: "Grace"
    - `age`: 14
- A green checkmark indicates that the JSON structure is correct.
- The background appears dark, typical of a code editor interface.

### Visual Elements:
- The text is formatted in a monospace font, emphasizing its code-like nature.
- The alignment and spacing suggest clarity and organization within the data representation.
```

which is shown incorrect just after adding 2 backslashes
