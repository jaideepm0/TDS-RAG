Okay so basically sometimes what happens is while verifying on FASTApi – it gives errors like missing paramaters like… So basically sometimes it needs resetting the request parser and then it works perfectly fine.

```
{
  "detail": "execute() missing 1 required positional argument: 'file_bytes'"
}

```

Which is incorrect, so if we press the RESET button and execute it works properly.

# Image Description

The image shows a web interface for submitting a request. 

## Components:

- **Parameters Section**: 
  - States "No parameters"
  
- **Request Body**: 
  - Contains a required field labeled "question" with the text: "Download and use multi-cursors and convert it into a single."
  - A file upload section labeled "file" with a placeholder text showing: `string | [Cargo] | null | [Binary?]`.
  - The button labeled "Choose File" indicates that a file can be selected for upload.

- **Execution Area**: 
  - Two buttons at the bottom: 
    - **Execute**: A blue button.
    - **Clear**: A text link next to the Execute button.

- **Response Section**: 
  - An area labeled "Responses" appears below the execution area, but no further details are provided.

The overall design features a clean, light background, with clear labels for user interaction.
```

Correct output image –  

```markdown
# Server Response

- **Status Code:** 200
- **Response Body:**
  ```json
  {
      "name": "20a5577797c6a319871b3f2352110665119232381b9fc5d97545"
  }
  ```

- **Details:**
  - The response indicates a successful request with the status code 200.
  - The response body contains a JSON object with a single key, "name", associated with a long string value.
  
- **Download Option:** A button to download the response is available.
```

Hope you get my point which i’m trying to convey sir.
