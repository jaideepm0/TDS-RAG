As per the portal, we have to return a JSON object as a response from the API. However, if we load a JSON object directly using `json.load()`, it will throw an error. We need to first convert it into a JSON string and then load it using `json.loads( )`. For clarity I add image below.

This question has been stretched for too long—it’s not that big.

I guess [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) is right.

## Image Description

The image displays a Python code snippet that deals with JSON processing. It contains two main sections of code with the following details:

1. **First Code Block**:
   - Imports the `json` library.
   - Defines a dictionary `my_response` containing one key-value pair: `"answer": "26272"`.
   - Attempts to print the value associated with the `"answer"` key using `print(json.loads(my_response)["answer"])`.
   - This line leads to a `TypeError`, indicating that the JSON object must be a string, bytes, or bytearray.

2. **Error Message**:
   - The error message details the `TypeError` and points to the line in the code that triggered the error. It highlights the issue with the `loads()` method requiring a properly formatted JSON string.

3. **Second Code Block**:
   - Re-imports the `json` library and redefines `my_response` as before.
   - Includes a comment explaining that `json.dumps(my_response)` is used to convert the JSON object into a string.
   - Correctly prints the `"answer"` value.

Overall, the image illustrates error handling while working with JSON in Python, emphasizing the correct use of JSON methods.
