What does it mean to solve the question?  
Everyone is asking that?  
Do you yourself know what to do and to go about it?  
Or just pull out something from your hAtSS at the last moment?

“and responds with the answer to enter in the assignment.”  
From my understanding only those questions that are solved with a program and give an answer are to be considered… For example it states in the project that   
" The response must be a JSON object with a single text (string) field: `answer` that can be directly entered in the assignment. For example:"  
If you all still have not responded, then I’m honestly not sure if this is what y’all meant.  
Last project was not clear to some extent, This time its even more vague.

I understand that y’all want to give different projects to help High Order Thinking skills, but if not executed properly, no one actually learns anything and we(I) just end by debugging the project statement code and question with no relevance to the project. If we wanted to do that, I could just go random GitHub repos and solve and create pull requests for a specific bug. Also we end up losing interest thinking most if the course instructors don’t what they are doing. I understand Anand Sir is extremely busy(like really busy lol), but what are the course instructors doing?
