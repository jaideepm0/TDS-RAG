I received this mail from TDS Google Group Announcement this morning at 10:30 am. The Project 2 submission date mentioned in the mail i.e. 15 March 2025 contradicts with submission date mentioned in [Tools in Data Science](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/project-2) and  
[Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029) i.e. 31 March 2025. Please clarify.
