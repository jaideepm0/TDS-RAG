Hello [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) , [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Sir When i test it locally , my LLM is working fine , even running the app , it gave result in 2 sec ,  
I dont know what happened in the logs , it was showing some runtime error ,  
As i am using free plan of vercel , so it allow for 10 sec only ,  
I think any heavy file being run , so it just take some more time , more than 10 sec , but inbuild feature of free plan allow to run only 10 sec â€¦ and thats why this happened , i guess

does it means , my LLM failed ??  
Can you please try some other question , it will work , or even for heavy question it work ,  
You can check its working from interface too  
Please check once !!
