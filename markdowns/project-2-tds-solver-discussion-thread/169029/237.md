## Ticket Sales Data

There is a `tickets` table in a SQLite database with the following columns: `type`, `units`, and `price`. Each row represents a customer bid for a concert ticket.

| type   | units | price |
|--------|-------|-------|
| bronze | 297   | 0.6   |
| Bronze | 673   | 1.62  |
| Silver | 105   | 1.26  |
| Silver | 82    | 0.79  |
| SILVER | 121   | 0.84  |
| ...    |       |       |
