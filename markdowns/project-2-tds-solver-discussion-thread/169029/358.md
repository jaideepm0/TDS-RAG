[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) I too faced the same issue, I received a bunch of hits from random ip addresses and it got shut down.

## Log File Summary

The image displays a terminal output of server logs with various entries detailing HTTP requests. Below are the key components:

- **Warnings & Information:**
  - Multiple warnings indicating "Invalid HTTP request received."
  - Repeated entries showing 404 errors, which indicate that the requested resources were not found on the server.

- **Notable IP Addresses:**
  - Several entries from various IP addresses, including:
    - `104.234.115.27`
    - `123.57.165.38`
    - `172.172.247.67`
  
- **Types of Requests:**
  - `GET` requests for various pages, leading to 404 errors, including paths such as:
    - `/manage/account/login`
    - `/admin/index.html`
    - `/index.html`
    - And others.

This output highlights issues with HTTP requests, primarily 404 errors and invalid requests.

I started it once again. Can you please reevaluate it now if it hasn’t been done yet. I actually tested it till 3rd of April and it was working fine. I don’t know what actually happened. Please do consider.

Actually in the free tier there are many issues. These issues are beyond our control and I request the TDS team to please consider this issue and please consider re-evaluating it if it has not been done yet as we had put in a lot of efforts.
