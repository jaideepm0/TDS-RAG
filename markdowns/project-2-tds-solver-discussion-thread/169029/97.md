1. I have a doubt like when I pass answers in string and in the questions about markdown will the \n characters be properly parsed before checking the correctness of the markdown or will it be directly checked for valid markdown? Because the raw string when pasted in the text box of the GA isnâ€™t getting the markdown.
2. In case of image compression question, should I return the base64 encoding of the compressed image?
