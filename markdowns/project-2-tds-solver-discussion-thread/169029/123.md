Your markdown must have newline characters or spaces wherever necessary. Otherwise we will not be able to check if your answer is correct. Our parser will only work if encodings for the formatting are present in the response. If there are no encodings (invisible or visible) then we will not have the correctly formatted file.

Please review module 1 for a better understanding about how text is encoded. Especially invisible characters.

The browser is designed for user friendliness. Thats why the characters are invisible when you copy paste string with newlines. But it exists.

The programmatic strings show invisible encodings as escaped characters. (Usually)

To check if a string has invisible characters,

```
# Multi-line string
my_string = """Hello
World    with    spaces 
and some newlines
and a tab	"""

# Print ASCII values of each character
print([ord(c) for c in my_string])

```

e.g., newline = 10, tab = 9

This is a great way to check what we are receiving when you send us some response,

```
import requests
import json

# This is just an example server to see what we see.

url = "https://httpbin.org/post"

my_multiline_string_answer = """This is a multiline
string that spans
multiple lines    with    spaces 
and some newlines
and a tab	as well."""

response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator = {
"answer": my_multiline_string_answer
}

# Send the JSON data
response = requests.post (url, json=response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator)

# Check the response
print (response.status_code)
print (response.json ())
print (response.text)

# Do other checks as necessary... 

```

See what happens when I print the result

```
print (json.loads (response.text)['json']['answer'])

```

```markdown
# Terminal Output

The image shows a terminal session on a macOS system. 

- **Current Directory**: `/Users/tds`
- **File Executed**: `test.py`
  
### Output Text:
```
This is a multiline
string that spans
multiple lines  with  spaces
and some newlines
and a tab    as well.
```

- The text includes:
  - Multiple lines.
  - Extra spaces between words.
  - Newlines.
  - A tab character.
```

Its a proper multiline correctly formatted text! The encodings are invisible just like in the original as well as in your clipboard when you copy paste into the GA.

Here is a json example:

```
json_answer = {
    "mary": "poppins",
    "age": 42
}

stringed_json = json.dumps (json_answer)
response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator = {
"answer": stringed_json
}

response = requests.post (url, json=response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator)

print (json.loads (response.text)['json']['answer'])

```

Look at the response. A perfect json.  
```markdown
## Image Description

The image displays a terminal window from a macOS environment. 

### Key Elements:
- **Command Prompt**: 
  - `venvcarland@Carlton-MacBook-Pro tds %`
- **Executed Command**: 
  - `tds/test.py`
- **Output**: 
  - A JSON-like structure: 
    ```json
    {"mary": "poppins", "age": 42}
    ```

### Appearance:
- The terminal has a dark background with white text.
- Syntax highlighting is minimal, focusing mainly on the command and output.

This captures the context of running a Python script and its resulting output.
```

If you do not want spaces in the response then strip the spaces before you send the stringified response.

Kind regards
