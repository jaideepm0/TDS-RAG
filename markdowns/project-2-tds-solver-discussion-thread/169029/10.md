# Image Description

The image contains a user interface element with the following text:

## Title
**Deploy your application**

## Body Text
Deploy your application to a public URL that can be accessed by anyone. You may use any platform, including Vercel.

---

The background is dark, and the text is predominantly white, creating a clear contrast for readability. A horizontal line separates the title from the body text.

  
Hello Sir,

I understand that we can deploy on vercel. Can it be deployed on Heroku as well? I believe both serve the same purpose. Wanted to know your thoughts on the same sir.

Thanks and Regards
