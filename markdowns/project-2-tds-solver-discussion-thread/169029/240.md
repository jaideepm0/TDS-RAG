Sir, I have created the frontend app like an html page with the fastapi utilizing the chatgpt-o3 , instead of Api key. I managed to get api keys but ended up in only text mining without file handing (not able to do multipart-form data). So, I have made to use the model and designed a frontend which also takes the input from the file uploaded, So, it will be ideal for assignment solver, Isnâ€™t it , Sir?
