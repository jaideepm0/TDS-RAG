Sir, a few things are not yet clear .

 Jivraj:

> file format will be exactly same as corresponding GA.

Some questions have **clickable html buttons**. When we click that, the zipfile or json file, or csv gets downloaded

Some questions have **image attached to the text**. For this, we have to use **right click → download the image**. Here, the image is take from some url. For example. in GA2, q2, the image displayed is taken from <https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png>.

My doubt is, what will be the value of file attribute in curl command

Will it be

* “file=binary of zipfile/csv/json” for the first type and
* “file=<https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png>” for the second type

 Jivraj:

> This is correct html table format.

Will this table be in the “question” attribute of curl or “file” attribute

 Jivraj:

> In last question of GA5 there is only one file(image), table is not coming through file, it will be kept same for project2.

so, can I assume that the table will be given as a html element in the “question” attribute and the image in the “file” attribute?
