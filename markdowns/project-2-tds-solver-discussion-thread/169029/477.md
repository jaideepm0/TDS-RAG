I just got the mail stating that my evaluation is complete and I can turn off my server.  
However the Cloud Run logs show that all POST requests were made to the wrong end point.

The exact url I gave ends with “/api/” but every POST request was either made to “/api” which resulted in a 307 response or with “http” instead of “https” which resulted in a 302 response. Only the get requests were made to the correct endpoint but since the app was supposed to allow POST requests only, making GET requests just resulted in 405.

This screenshot captures the details of system logging within Google Cloud's Cloud Run service interface.

I request you to use the exact url I gave in the gform and make POST requests to it to re-evaluate me. I gave the exact url as asked in the form.
