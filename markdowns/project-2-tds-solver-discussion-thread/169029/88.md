For GA-1 question 10,  
we need to get the hash of the json, from the site [JSON Hash](https://tools-in-data-science.pages.dev/jsonhash),  
I found that underneath it using sha-256 in a function inside the encrypt.js file but still when I implemented the same in python, it is giving a different hash. Can we get the hashing code in python?

Update:

* I was successful in getting the hash in js.
