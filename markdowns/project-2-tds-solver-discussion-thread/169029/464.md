## Image Description

The image displays a computer screen showing a Jupyter Notebook interface. 

### Key Elements:
- **File Path**: The notebook is titled "Untitled79.ipynb".
- **Code Snippet**: 
  - There is a code block which includes:
    - A URL: `https://tds-project-2-ruby.vercel.app/api/`
    - Several tasks related to processing CSV files encoded in different formats (CP-1252, UTF-8, UTF-16).
    - A question prompting the user to download and process data files from a zip file.
- **Response Handling**: The code includes a request to post data and print the response status code.
- **Connectivity Warning**: A note indicates that there is a CAPTCHA challenge due to the need to verify a connection.

### Visual Aspects:
- The interface appears slightly scratched or marked, affecting the clarity of certain areas.
- The background contains a browser window, likely for Google Colab, indicating that the coding is being done in an online environment.
