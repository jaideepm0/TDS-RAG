What Jivraj agreed was stringifying the answer and putting it in as the value of the `"answer"` key in the JSON object.  
`{ "answer" : "YOUR_STRINGIFIED_ANSWER" }`

Just check the Project 2 page on the portal. Itâ€™s clearly mentioned a JSON object has to sent not a strigified version of the entire JSON object.

## Image Description

The image contains an instructional text regarding JSON format. Key elements include:

- **Instruction**: The response must be a JSON object with a single text (string) field labeled `answer`.
- **Example**: 
  ```json
  {
    "answer": "1234567890"
  }
  ```

Highlighted words include "answer" and "string," indicating their significance in the context of the assignment.
