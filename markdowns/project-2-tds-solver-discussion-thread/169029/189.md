Its unusual to have a docker container worth 7 GBs of space. Here is what you can do

* Remove unused libraries from your `requirements.txt`. Sometimes having resource demanding libraries like `SentenceTransformers` can install large sub-dependency packages.
* Exclude your virtual environment folder from the container creation
* Create a `.containerignore` file to have an exception for those folders you want to skip.
* Clear your package cache and any vscode cache you might have.
