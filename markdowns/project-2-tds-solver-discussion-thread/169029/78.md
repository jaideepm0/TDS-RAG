For GA 1, question 2  

```markdown
## Image Description

The image displays a code snippet and instructions related to making an HTTPS request using the Python package `httpie`. 

### Key Points:
- The command `uv run --with httpie -- https [URL]` is mentioned, which installs `httpie` and sends an HTTPS request to a specified URL.
- It instructs to send a request to `https://httpbin.org/get` with a URL-encoded email parameter set to `21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`.
- A prompt asks for the JSON output of this command, specifically requesting only the JSON body, excluding headers.

### JSON Output Example:
```json
{
    "args": {
        "email": "21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"
    },
    "headers": {
        "Accept": "*/*",
        "Accept-Encoding": "identity"
    }
}
```

### Additional Context:
- A button labeled "Check" is present, likely intended for submission or validation of the request.
```

  
The portal accept answers in strict json with double quotes. Now in the project we need to return the answer in string value which again has double quotes, so the best answer I could get is using `\"` inside the answer like this.

```markdown
## Image Description

The image displays a snippet of code, characterized by a JSON-like data structure. The key components include:

- **"answer"**: This appears to be the main object.
  - **"args"**: Contains an object with an **"email"** field, showing a specific email address: `21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`.
  - **"headers"**: This contains another object with various fields:
    - **"Accept"**: Specified as `*/*`.
    - **"Accept-Encoding"**: Includes compression types (not fully visible).
    - **"Host"**: Points to a hostname (`httpbin.org`).
    - **"User-Agent"**: Indicates details about the client making the request, starts with `HTTP/2.0`.
    - An additional field, `X-Amzn-Trace-Id`, hinted but not fully visible.

The code is formatted in a way that suggests it may be related to HTTP requests or API interactions.
```

But still the GA portal marks it as invalid json. What to do in this case?
