hello i want to know about this currently I am using approach like you provide HTML page URL and my internal approach and run hidden value or you provide URL website

## Image Description

The image features a web interface with the following elements:

- **Text**: 
  - A line stating, "Just above this paragraph, there's a hidden input with a secret value."
  - A question asking, "What is the value in the hidden input?"

- **Input Field**: 
  - There is a light gray input box where users can type their response.

- **Button**: 
  - A blue button labeled "Check" located below the input field.

The overall design is simple and functional, focused on user interaction.
