[@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir, I want to clarify something about the peer grading process. Some of the files of the student assigned to me are not accessble and others are missing. How am I to grade each thing? From what I understand analysis must be graded based on the shared files but if im not able to access them what should I do? I think requesting view access might violate the spirit of the grading exercise.

Please help me out on what to do. Thanks.

# Image Description

The image depicts a Google Sheets access request interface. 

- **Header**: Includes the Google Sheets logo.
- **Main Message**: "You need access" is prominently displayed.
- **Requests Prompt**: It instructs the user to request access or switch accounts.
- **Optional Message Field**: There is a text box labeled "Message (optional)" where the user can type a message.
- **Action Button**: A blue button labeled "Request access" is present.
- **User Information**: At the bottom, it states, "You're signed in as 22f2000644@ds.study.iitm.ac.in."
- **Illustration**: On the right side, there is a stylized illustration of a person reaching towards an abstract shape, adding a visual element to the interface. 

The overall design is minimalist, with a clean layout and a modern aesthetic.

Upon checking further, in the assignment we were asked only to share access with se2002@study.iitm.ac.in . So I think all of us might have this issue. what do we do?

# Tasks

1. Create a new blank Google Sheet workbook, named `ga.7.1.rollno` (replace 'rollno' with your IITM roll number excluding the domain).
2. Share with editing rights to `se2002@study.iitm.ac.in`. If you do not do this step first, on a blank workbook we will not consider your submission.
