# Image Description

The image is a screenshot from GitHub Docs, specifically from the section on adding a license to a repository. 

## Key Elements:

- **Header**: The top displays "GitHub Docs" along with a version indicator ("Free, Pro, & Team") and a breadcrumb navigation leading to the article title: "Add a license to a repo."
  
- **Instructions**:
  - **Step 3**: Instructs users to type `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md` in the file name field, highlighted in bold.
  - **Step 4**: Contains a visual of a file name input field labeled with "octo-repo / LICENSE" and a button labeled "Choose a license template."
  
- **Additional Information**: 
  - On the left, it prompts users to review available licenses and select one.
  - Step 6 encourages users to click "Review and submit."

The overall layout showcases a clear, step-by-step guide for users on how to add a license to their project on GitHub.

I checked your github repo MIT License file is named as `Licenese.md` but standard naming for License is LICENSE or LICENSE.md (with all caps).
