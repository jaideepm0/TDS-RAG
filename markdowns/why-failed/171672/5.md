I submitted the project **within the deadline**, and I ensured that **all requirements were fulfilled**, including correctly adding the MIT License file. The license file was named properly and contained the correct content.

However, I received a message stating that the MIT License was not present, and that the prerequisites were not completed — resulting in a failed status. This is surprising and feels unfair, as I’ve double-checked my submission and confirmed that everything, including the license file, is in place and named correctly.

Here is my GitHub repo for your reference: [GitHub - virajpitale/tds-project1](https://github.com/virajpitale/tds-project1)

I kindly request a re-evaluation of my submission, as I believe I’ve met all the required criteria. I would really appreciate your time in looking into this matter again.

Thank you for your understanding.
