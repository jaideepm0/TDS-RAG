**Information & Best Practices:**

- ✅ **Virtual Environments**:
  - Always use a virtual environment (e.g., `venv` or `conda`) to isolate dependencies for each project.
  - Benefits: Isolation, reproducibility, portability.
  - Essential for projects with many dependencies (e.g., ML or Flask apps).
  - For simple scripts with few dependencies, global install may be acceptable, but not recommended for deployment.

- ✅ **Dependency Management**:
  - For experimentation, installing with `pip install package-name` is fine.
  - For sharing, deployment, or collaboration: use a `requirements.txt` file.
  - Create `requirements.txt` automatically with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.
  - Pin versions wisely:
    - Strict pinning (`==`) ensures exact versions but may cause install errors.
    - Use flexible versioning (`>=, <`) to allow safe updates while avoiding major breaking changes.

**Q&A Example:**

Question: Should I use a virtual environment instead of installing packages globally? And is `requirements.txt` better than installing packages individually?

Answer: Yes, using a virtual environment is best practice to avoid conflicts and ensure consistency. Use `requirements.txt` to list and share dependencies for reproducibility. Pin versions carefully, and use `pip freeze` to generate the file.

**Additional Tips:**
- For deployment: always use a virtual environment.
- Periodically review dependencies to avoid outdated/insecure packages.
