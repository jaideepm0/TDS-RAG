# Code Description

The image contains Python code that calculates distances between various communities and a central command post using the Haversine formula.

## Code Breakdown

1. **Importing the Library**:
   ```python
   from haversine import haversine
   ```

2. **Defining Coordinates**:
   Coordinates for four communities and a central command post are defined:
   - `OakParkTown`: (27.0096, -72.3822)
   - `EastSpringsSettlement`: (27.0769, -72.394)
   - `EastFieldsJunction`: (27.0961, -72.4248)
   - `RedPointTown`: (26.9874, -72.426)
   - `CentralCommandPostLocation`: (27.0552, -72.4893)

3. **Calculating Distances**:
   A dictionary is created to store the distances between each community and the central command post:
   ```python
   distances = {
       "OakParkTown": haversine(OakParkTown, CentralCommandPostLocation),
       "EastSpringsSettlement": haversine(EastSpringsSettlement, CentralCommandPostLocation),
       "EastFieldsJunction": haversine(EastFieldsJunction, CentralCommandPostLocation),
       "RedPointTown": haversine(RedPointTown, CentralCommandPostLocation)
   }
   ```

4. **Sorting Communities**:
   The communities are sorted based on their distances:
   ```python
   optimal_sequence = sorted(distances, key=distances.get)
   ```

5. **Printing the Evacuation Sequence**:
   The optimal evacuation sequence along with distances is printed:
   ```python
   for i, community in enumerate(optimal_sequence, start=1):
       print(f"{i}. {community} - Distance: {distances[community]:.2f} km")
   ```

## Output Sample

1. EastFieldsJunction - Distance: 7.84 km
2. EastSpringsSettlement - Distance: 9.74 km
3. RedPointTown - Distance: 9.81 km
4. OakParkTown - Distance: 11.76 km
```

## Image Description

The image presents a multiple-choice question related to community evacuation strategies based on geographical coordinates. 

- **Communities and Their Coordinates:**
  - Oak Park Town: (27.0096, -72.3822)
  - East Springs Settlement: (27.0769, -72.394)
  - East Fields Junction: (27.0961, -72.4248)
  - Red Point Town: (26.9874, -72.426)

- **Central Command Post Location:**
  - (27.0552, -72.4893)

- **Question:** 
  It asks for the optimal sequence for evacuating communities using a "nearest community first" strategy, based on the shortest path distance between each location.

- **Answer Options:**
  1. ['Start/End', 'East Fields Junction', 'East Springs Settlement', 'Oak Park Town', 'Red Point Town', 'Start/End']
  2. ['Oak Park Town', 'East Fields Junction', 'East Springs Settlement', 'Red Point Town', 'Start/End']
  3. ['Start/End', 'East Springs Settlement', 'Oak Park Town', 'East Fields Junction', 'Red Point Town', 'Start/End']
  4. ['Start/End', 'Red Point Town', 'Oak Park Town', 'East Springs Settlement', 'East Fields Junction', 'Start/End']

There is a tool tip indicating the need to consider the coordinates of each community and the central command post location for this task.

I solved it in colab but options are getting mismatched thereâ€¦kindly clarify this issue..
