## Image Description

The image displays a question directed at a strategic consultant for a premium motorcycle dealership chain. The objective is to analyze factors influencing motorcycle resale value in Maharashtra. Specifically, it focuses on evaluating the impact of:

- Mileage (km/l)
- Average daily distance traveled
- Engine capacity

The goal is to use the Pearson Correlation Coefficient to assess the relationship between these factors and price retention (calculated as resale price/original price) for Honda motorcycles. 

Several options with correlation values are listed:
- **AvgDistance**: -0.04
- **AvgDistance**: 0.95
- **EngineCapacity**: -0.04
- **Mileage**: -0.04 (selected option)
```

  
what to do if 3 options have same value -0.04 and all are correct?
