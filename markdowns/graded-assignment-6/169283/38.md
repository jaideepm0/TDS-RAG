Thank you sir. i have got questions 1 and 2 both marked as 0.

## Image Description

The image depicts a question related to a strategic analysis for a premium motorcycle dealership chain in Maharashtra. The text outlines the objective of evaluating factors that influence motorcycle resale value, emphasizing three specific metrics:

1. **Mileage (km/l)** 
2. **Average Daily Distance Traveled**
3. **Engine Capacity**

The question prompts the evaluation of these factors using Pearson Correlation Coefficient to assess their impact on price retention (calculated as resale price/original price).

In the answer options, the following values are given:

- **AvgDistance:** 0.01
- **Mileage:** 0.03
- **EngineCapacity:** -0.06
- **Mileage:** 0.95

It indicates that the initial provided answer is incorrect, stating a score of 0. The correct answer is highlighted as **'Mileage: 0.03'**.

In my case Please note the above two questions are asked to calculate pearson correlation coefficient for KTM brand and for maharashtra and Karnataka states.  
I have used excel to calculate the pearson correlation coefficient. Below the values I got for each question. Please verify.

|pearson correlation coefficient between impact of Mileage and Price retention for kTM brand for Karnataka||  
-0.026685695

|pearson correlation coefficient between average distance travelled and Price retention for kTM for karnataka||  
0.003953219

|pearson correlation coefficient between average Engine capacity and Price retention for kTM for karnataka||  
-0.010839295

|pearson correlation coefficient between impact of Mileage and Price retention for kTM brand for maharashta||  
0.029128825

|pearson correlation coefficient between average distance travelled and Price retention for kTM for Maharashtra||  
0.013019585

|pearson correlation coefficient between average Engine capacity and Price retention for kTM for Maharashtra||
