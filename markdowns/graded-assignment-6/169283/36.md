   - Average Distance: -0.13
   - Engine Capacity (another mention): 0.09
3. **Output**: The question states that a specific answer is incorrect, with a score of 0 being displayed.
4. **Accepted Answers**: The correct answer is indicated as 'EngineCapacity: 0.09'.

# Correlation Matrix

The image shows a correlation matrix displayed as a heatmap, representing the relationships between various numeric variables related to vehicles. The variables include:

- **Mileage (km/l)**
- **Avg Daily Distance (km)**
- **Engine Capacity (cc)**
- **Price Retention (%)**

## Correlation Values

The values in the matrix indicate the strength and direction of the correlation between the pairs of variables, ranging from -1 to 1:

- **1.00** denotes a perfect positive correlation.
- **0.00** indicates no correlation.
- **-1.00** indicates a perfect negative correlation.

### Notable correlations:

- **Engine Capacity (cc) and Price Retention (%)**: Strong positive correlation (0.09).
- **Avg Daily Distance (km) and Price Retention (%)**: Weak negative correlation (-0.13).
- **Mileage (km/l) and Engine Capacity (cc)**: Weak positive correlation (0.04).
- **Mileage (km/l) and Price Retention (%)**: Weak positive correlation (0.01).

## Color Gradient

The color scheme ranges from dark blue (negative correlation) to dark red (positive correlation), with the values highlighted in corresponding shades.

So shouldn’t it be -0.13?
