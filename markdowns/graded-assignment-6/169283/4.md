I have similar concern  
For Q1, I used the following code:

```
print(f'Pearson correlation for Karnataka between price retention and column')
kk = df[df['State'] == 'Karnataka']
for col in ['Mileage (km/l)', 'Avg Daily Distance (km)', 'Engine Capacity (cc)']:
    pearson_corr = kk['price_retention'].corr(kk[col])
    print(f'\t{col:25} : {pearson_corr:.2f}')

```

And got the following output:

```
Pearson correlation for Karnataka between price retention and column
	Mileage (km/l)            : 0.03
	Avg Daily Distance (km)   : -0.06
	Engine Capacity (cc)      : -0.04

```

Whereas options are below where none of them are correct.

## Image Description

The image displays a series of selectable options in a radio button format. The options are as follows:

1. **Mileage: 0.95** (unselected)
2. **AvgDistance: -0.05** (selected, indicated by a blue dot)
3. **Mileage: 0.21** (unselected)
4. **EngineCapacity: 0.17** (unselected)

The selected option is highlighted, indicating the choice made by the user.
```

Whereas for Q2 (Punjab and Yamaha) I used the following code:

```
print(f'Pearson correlation for Punjab and Yamaha between price retention and column')
pb = df[(df['State'] == 'Punjab') & (df['Brand'] == 'Yamaha')]
for col in ['Mileage (km/l)', 'Avg Daily Distance (km)', 'Engine Capacity (cc)']:
    pearson_corr = pb['price_retention'].corr(pb[col])
    print(f'\t{col:25} : {pearson_corr:.2f}')

```

and got the following answers:

```
Pearson correlation for Punjab and Yamaha between price retention and column
	Mileage (km/l)            : 0.24
	Avg Daily Distance (km)   : -0.06
	Engine Capacity (cc)      : -0.08

```

The options for Q2 are given below and 2 of them are correct (AvgDistance and Mileage).

## Image Description

The image displays a series of selectable options presented in a list format, likely related to vehicle metrics. Each option is associated with a numerical value, indicating some measure:

- **Mileage: 0.95** (not selected)
- **AvgDistance: -0.06** (not selected)
- **Mileage: 0.24** (selected, indicated by a blue circle)
- **EngineCapacity: -0.08** (not selected)

The selected option (Mileage: 0.24) is highlighted to indicate it has been chosen by the user.
