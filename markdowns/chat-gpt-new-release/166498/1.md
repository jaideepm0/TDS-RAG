Chat GPT has stepped up the game and I am excited 

Now I can not only generate the code, but can run it and ask it to fix the error with a single click. This changes software development and I guess we are moving in the direction we all know. It also makes this course a lot more important - the number of new things that I have learnt from this course which I am able to directly apply to my day to day work is immense. Thanks to [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) and the entire course team who designed this amazing course

I hope ChatGPT solves deployment next

  - There are several error messages displayed, indicating issues with module imports and potential misconfigurations in handling environments.
  - The final line indicates a successful execution of the 'Run' command.
