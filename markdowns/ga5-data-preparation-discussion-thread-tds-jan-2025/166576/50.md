[@daksh76](/u/daksh76) thats because your innermost logic layer must not return a long list of results.

If you think about it logically each row cannot have a column field where one of the columns is a whole row of results right?

Thats why you are getting the error.

Check your innermost layer is returning a single value or a row of results.

Kind regards
