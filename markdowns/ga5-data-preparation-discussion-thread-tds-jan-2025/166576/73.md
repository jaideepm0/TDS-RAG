# Image Description

The image shows a web interface for an online exam or assignment on a platform called "exam.savard.workers.dev." 

## Details:

- **Timer:** There is a countdown timer displayed at the top, showing "11:35:28 left."
- **Request Information:** The section includes instructions on how to format HTTP requests, particularly GET requests, mentioning the structure and necessary components such as:
  - Request Method: GET
  - Protocol: HTTP/1.1
  - Example: HTTP status code (200) indicating a successful request
- **Field Specification:** Instructions on how fields should be formatted, including the use of quotes and CSV files.
- **Context Information:** Mentions the GMT-0500 timezone and indicates that questions are based on this timezone.
- **Questions and Tasks:** There is a question regarding successful GET requests for a specific URL path (`/malayalammp3`) within a specified timeframe (from 10:00 until before 17:00 on Saturday).
- **Input Box:** There is a text box for entering an answer, with the current input showing "2316" and a message indicating it was an "Incorrect answer."
- **Navigation Elements:** There are navigation buttons such as "Check" and possible links or icons mentioned at the bottom.

The background looks like a standard green theme interface with clear sections for instructions and input.

  
after trying python codes chatgpt i tried using linux commands  
bash-5.2$ zgrep ‘GET /malayalammp3/’ s-anand.net-May-2024.gz   
| grep -E ‘[(04|11|18|25)/May/2024:(10|11|12|13|14|15|16):[0-5][0-9]:[0-5][0-9]’   
| grep -E ’ “(GET|POST) .\* HTTP/1.[01]” (2[0-9][0-9]) ’ | wc -l
