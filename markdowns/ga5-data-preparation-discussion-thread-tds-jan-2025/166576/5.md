## Image Description

The image displays a user interface related to an exam or assessment platform. It features the following components:

1. **Recent Saves Section**: 
   - A dark green box indicating no recent saves and stating that this is the official score.

2. **Loading Section**: 
   - A blue box with a loading spinner and the text "Loading questions...".

3. **Error Message**: 
   - A dark red box containing an error message:
     - "Error! Sorry, we couldn't load the questions: That's strange."
     - Additional technical details: "cannot read properties of undefined (reading '1')"
     - A prompt for assistance: "Please contact the exam team for assistance."

4. **Buttons**:
   - Two buttons at the bottom:
     - "Check all" (in green)
     - "Save" (in blue)

The overall theme of the interface is dark, likely designed for easy reading in low-light environments.
