# Improving Sales Data Accuracy for RetailWise Inc.

**RetailWise Inc.** is a retail analytics firm that supports companies in optimizing their pricing, margins, and inventory decisions. Their reports depend on accurate historical sales data, but legacy data sources are often messy. RetailWise received an Excel sheet containing 1,000 transaction records generated from scanned receipts. Due to OCR inconsistencies and legacy formatting issues, the data in the Excel sheet is not clean.

## Excel File Structure

The Excel file has the following columns, and they are messy:

- **Customer Name**: Contains leading/trailing spaces.
- **Country**: Uses inconsistent representations. Instead of 2-letter abbreviations, it also contains other values like "USA" vs. "US", "U.K", "Fra" for France, "Bra" for Brazil, "Ind" for India.
- **Date**: Uses mixed formats like "MM-DD-YYYY", "YYYY/MM/DD", etc.
- **Product**: Includes a product name followed by a slash and a random code (e.g., "Theta/5x01vd"). Only the product name part (before the slash) is relevant.
- **Sales and Cost**: Contain extra spaces and the currency string ("USD"). In some cases, the Cost field is missing. When it is missing, it should be treated as 50% of the Sales value.
- **TransactionID**: Though formatted as four-digit numbers, this field may have inconsistent spacing.

## Your Task

You need to clean this Excel data and calculate the total margin for all transactions that satisfy the following criteria:

- **Time Filter**: Transactions that occurred up to and including a specified date (Tue Jun 14 2022 04:52:52 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)).
- **Product Filter**: Transactions for a specific product (Theta). Use only the product name before the slash.
- **Country Filter**: Transactions from a specific country (US), after standardizing the country names.

The total margin is defined as:

```
Total Margin = (Total Sales - Total Cost) / Total Sales
```

## Solution Challenges

Your solution should address the following challenges:

1. **Trim and Normalize Strings**: Remove extra spaces from the Customer Name and Country fields. Map inconsistent country names (e.g., "USA", "US") to a standardized format.
2. **Standardize Date Formats**: Detect and convert dates from "MM-DD-YYYY" and "YYYY/MM/DD" into a consistent date format (e.g., ISO 8601).
3. **Extract the Product Name**: From the Product field, extract the portion before the slash (e.g., extract "Theta" from "Theta/5x01vd").
4. **Clean and Convert Sales and Cost**: Remove the "USD" text and extra spaces from the Sales and Cost fields. Convert these fields to numerical values. Handle missing Cost appropriately (50% of Sales).
5. **Filter the Data**: Include only transactions up to and including Tue Jun 14 2022 04:52:52 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time), matching product Theta and country US.
6. **Calculate the Margin**: Sum the Sales and Cost for the filtered transactions. Compute the overall margin using the formula provided.

## Additional Information

By cleaning the data and calculating accurate margins, RetailWise Inc. can:

- **Improve Decision Making**: Provide clients with reliable analyses to optimize pricing and inventory.
- **Enhance Reporting**: Ensure historical data is consistent and accurate, boosting stakeholder confidence.
- **Streamline Operations**: Reduce the manual effort needed to clean data from legacy sources.

### Error Message

What is the total margin for transactions before Tue Jun 14 2022 04:52:52 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time) for Theta sold in US (which may be spelt in different ways)?

Error: Incorrect answer

**Total Margin**: `0.00`
```

  
In this question, I am asked to find the total margin for transactions before **Tue, Jun 14, 2022, 04:52:52 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)** for **Theta** sold in **the US** (which may be spelled in different ways).

However, when I filter in Excel for **US** and **Theta**, there are no entries for **Sales** and **Cost**. But **0** as the answer is not acceptedâ€”it says the answer is incorrect.
