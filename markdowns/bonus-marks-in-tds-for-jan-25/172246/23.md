To all the people who are posting in this thread, I kindly request you to get the correct facts and data before starting a new thread.

So here are the first steps towards making this thread a more informed one:

1. What is the policy related to bonus for Diploma level courses as per grading policy document?
2. What is the policy adopted in previous instances of TDS?
3. Did anyone read the text related to bonus marks associated with GA7?
4. Does anyone know what should be done to get the bonus?
5. Has anyone inquired about effort involved in getting the bonus?
6. After answering all the above, has someone actually tried to follow instructions in the “mail” to get the bonus?

Patiently waiting for all your responses.
