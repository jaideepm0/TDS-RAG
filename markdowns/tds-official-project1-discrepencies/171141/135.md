Hello sir

I noticed that the log mentioned:  
“python: can’t open file ‘/app/app/main.py’: [Errno 2] No such file or directory.”

However, my main file was named run.py, which might have caused the issue. Since the code was present, I was given a 0. Would it be possible to run it again or consider partial marks for the submission?

Thank you for your time and consideration. I appreciate your help!
