There might be some glitches in the system. Could you kindly verify the process again?

  Dear Learner,

  Project 1 requires you to pass some pre-requisite checks as detailed on the TDS Project 1: Evaluation page:

  1. Your GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible.
  2. Your GitHub repository has a LICENSE file with the MIT license.
  3. Your GitHub repository has a valid Dockerfile.
  4. Your Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via podman run -e AIRFLOW_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN -p 8080:8000 IMAGE_NAME.
  5. Your Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in your GitHub repository.

  If you fail to meet this minimum requirement your submission will not get evaluated.

  **Prerequisite evaluations:**
  - Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: **PASS**
  - Is docker present AND public: **FAIL**
  - Is incorrect license present in root of github repo: **FAIL**
  - Is MIT license present in root of github repo: **FAIL**
  
  **Prerequisites:** FAIL  
  **Project 1 Score:** 0
```

Iâ€™ve already received my score in the evaluation log. Additionally, the Docker Hub run logs show no errors, and both the GitHub repo and Docker image are publicly accessible. All the content has been verified and meets the prerequisites.

Let me know if any further action is needed from my end.
