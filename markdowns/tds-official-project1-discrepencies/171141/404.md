# Image Description

The image displays the interface of a code editor, specifically Visual Studio Code. 

## Key Elements:

- **File Explorer Panel**: 
  - Located on the left side, it shows a directory named "Imagент."
  - Contains files: `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `Dockerfile`, `evaluate.py`, `LICENSE`, `readme.md`, `tasksA.py`, and `tasksB.py`.

- **Main Window**:
  - At the top, there is a 'Start' section with options such as "New File," "Open File," "Open Folder," "Clone Git Repository," and "Connect to...".
  - Below this, in the "Recent" section, a project labeled "Ilmagент..." is displayed. 

- **Terminal Output**:
  - The terminal shows a command for cloning a Git repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/23f2001390/Ilmagент.git
    ```
  - The output includes steps of the cloning process: enumerating, counting, compressing objects, resolving deltas, and indicating successful completion with data sizes.

- **Overall Color Scheme**:
  - The interface uses a dark theme characteristic of many modern code editors, enhancing readability against the light text.
```

  
cloned the repository using

```
git clone https://github.com/23f2001390/llmagent.git

  - `.env`
  - `app.py`
  - `datagen.py`
  - `Dockerfile`
  - `evaluate.py`
  - `LICENSE`
  - `readme.md`
  - `tasksA.py`

  ```plaintext
  AIPROXY_TOKEN=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJlbWFpbCI6Ij... 
  ```

- **Terminal Panel**: Below the file explorer, there's a terminal output showing commands executed in a command line interface. The command `git clone https://github.com/23f2001390/lmagent...` was executed, and various messages related to the cloning process are displayed, indicating progress in enumerating, counting, compressing, and resolving objects.

- **Status Information**: The terminal shows the completion status of the cloning process, detailing the number of objects processed and data received.

There are also additional panels labeled **PROBLEMS**, **OUTPUT**, **DEBUG CONSOLE**, **TERMINAL**, and **PORTS**.

created the `.env` for the aiproxy token as its needed to build the docker image as per my Dockerfile and `.env` file cannot be uploaded to git we have to create it while building docker image  

# Image Description

The image displays a screenshot of a coding environment, specifically Visual Studio Code (VS Code). 

## Layout
- The left panel shows the **Explorer** with several files and directories listed, including:
  - `.env`
  - `app.py`
  - `datagen.py`
  - `Dockerfile`
  - `README.md`
  - `task.py`
  - `tasks.py`
  - `evaluate.py`

## Code Snippet
The right panel contains the contents of the `evaluate.py` file, which appears to be a Python script. Key features include:
- A comment block indicating script requirements (`requires-python ">=3.13"`) and dependencies.
- Multiple import statements:
  - Importing standard libraries such as `sys`, `hashlib`, `http`, `json`, and `logging`.
  - Importing `numpy` as `np`.
  - Importing functions from `datetime` and `lxml.html`.
- A function `get_markdown()` with several defined helper functions: 
  - `get_dates()`
  - `get_contacts()`
  - `get_logs()`
  - `get_docs()`
  - `get_email()`
  - `get_credit_card()`
  - `get_tickets()`

The file is highlighted with syntax coloring typical for JavaScript and Python coding environments, making elements like keywords, strings, and functions visually distinctive.

got consistent 6/25 after even running the file 6 times [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) Please sir check this, just because my docker image needs .env, I cannot get full 0…I need to maintain my cgpa (by getting 0 in project my grade is going too close to E grade sir and already in D, already my ROE got bad due to technical issues which on the same day around 6pm after finding way to unlock the input of answers for roe I completed the roe again in short amount of time like 10 or 20 minutes and got 10/10 but still it was rejected because it was late, max 3 minutes after 1:45PM was allowed…I’m not asking to any extra marks, just my marks) I’m trying to improve it already I have 4 subjects in a single term, please give me atleast this marks with the bonus 1 mark for prerequisites (total 7)
