Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) ,

I couldnâ€™t find my Docker logs or evaluation logs in the latest result mail, even though I had passed the prerequisites. I also tried reproducing the test environment and scored 9/25 (screenshot attached below).  

```markdown
# Terminal Output Description

The image displays a terminal interface showing the results of HTTP requests and their statuses. 

## Content:

1. **HTTP Request 1:**
   - Request Type: `GET`
   - URL: `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/c5.txt`
   - Response: `"HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error"`
   - Error Message: 
     - **C5 failed:** Cannot read `/data/c5.txt`
     - **C5 STATUS:** FAILED
  
2. **Score:**
   - Current Score: `9 / 25`
  
3. **HTTP Request 2:**
   - Request Type: `POST`
   - URL: `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`
   - Response: `"HTTP/1.1 200 OK"`
```

Would really appreciate it if you could take a look. Thanks in advance!
