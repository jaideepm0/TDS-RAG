Respected Team,  
I received an email stating I failed to fulfil prerequisite and scored 0 because of it.  

```markdown
## Project 1 Prerequisite Evaluations

If you fail to meet this minimum requirement, your submission will not get evaluated.

### Evaluation Results:
- **Is Docker image present in Dockerhub AND is public:** **FAIL**
- **Is GitHub repo present AND public:** **PASS**
- **Is `Dockerfile` present in root of GitHub repo:** **PASS**
- **Is MIT license present at root of GitHub repo:** **PASS**

### Summary:
- **Prerequisites:** **FAIL**
- **Project 1 Score:** **0**
```

  
I checked my Docker Hub and there it is showing “Public”  

```markdown
## Image Description

The image shows a user interface, likely from a dashboard or web application, featuring a table with the following columns:

- **Name**: Lists items with the name "coolsisters7/llm".
- **Last Pushed**: Indicates that this item was last updated "about 1 month ago".
- **Contains**: The cell is empty or not specified.
- **Visibility**: Shows "Public".
- **Scout**: Indicates the status as "Inactive".

The overall design has a dark background, typical of modern web applications, enhancing readability and focus on the data presented.
```

  
Can Anyone explain what I did wrong ?
