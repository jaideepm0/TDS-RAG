[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) any updates for the people like me whose image was run on the wrong architecture - mine was ARM ( was evaluated or ×86 ). I filled the form that was later sent for selecting the architecture.

I haven’t received any mail since then. But found many mails are sent to others in while.
