Hi Haricharan

Your Dockerfile does not build the repo. Its misconfigured.  
This is the error when building it:

```
=> ERROR [8/8] COPY .env /app/                                                                                                                         0.0s

## Image Description

The image displays a snippet of a Dockerfile or similar configuration file. The text is formatted in a code-style font against a dark background. 

### Key Elements:

- **Comments:**
  - `# Set up the application directory`
  - `# Copy application files`
  
- **Commands:**
  - `WORKDIR /app` - Sets the working directory to `/app`.
  - `COPY *.py /app/` - Copies all Python files from the current directory to the `/app/` directory.
  - `COPY .env /app/` - This line is highlighted with an orange box and arrow, indicating that the `.env` file is also being copied to the `/app/` directory.

### Appearance:
- The code is clear and well-organized, providing a straightforward look at setting up a working environment for an application.
```

This is because if you look at your Dockerfile .env does not exist in your repo.  
Therefore it does not build.  
Your docker is supposed to take the AIPROXY token from our environment not from yours.  
This is passed dynamically at runtime of the Docker.

Since it fails to build, we cannot evaluate it.

Kind regards
