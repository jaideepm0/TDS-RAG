# Image Description

The image displays a user interface, likely from a version control system or a repository management platform. It features a table with the following columns:

- **Last Pushed**: Indicates when changes were last uploaded. One entry shows "about 2 hours ago" and another shows "2 months ago."
- **Contains**: There is a column labeled "IMAGE" for each entry.
- **Visibility**: Both entries are marked as "Public," with one instance highlighted in red.

The overall theme of the interface is dark.
