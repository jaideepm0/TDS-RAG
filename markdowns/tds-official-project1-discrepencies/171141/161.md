Respected Sir,

I have received a **FAIL** status for the prerequisite check:  
*“Is Docker image present in Docker Hub AND is public.”*

However, as shown in my Docker Hub repository, my Docker images are publicly accessible.

I have attached a screenshot for the reference.

Thank you for your time and support.
