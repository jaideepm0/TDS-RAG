Thanks for relentless efforts [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)

I tested the docker file in docker playground again.. Please find the screenshot of the docker build command and the log output of the docker build.. It went thru without issues..

Was the latest docker file used from git lab? Because as explained on March 30 i had to remove the hardcoded http/https proxies of my office environment,

# Image Description

The image displays a web interface for a Docker environment. Key components include:

- **Connection Status**: A timer showing "44:22" at the top left corner.
- **Session Information**:
  - Session ID: `cvqlf0l_cvqlfsol2o9000cd7icg`
  - IP Address: `192.168.0.13`
  - Memory and CPU Usage Information are displayed, but specifics are not visible.
- **SSH Access**: An SSH connection command is provided:
  ```
  ssh ip172-18-0-93-cvqlf0l0l2o9000cd7icg@direct.labs.play-
  ```
- **Commands**: A command prompt at the bottom where the user is executing:
  ```
  $ docker build -t tdproject1:latest . > tds-proj1build.log
  ```
- **Buttons**:
  - "OPEN PORT"
  - "DELETE"
  - "EDITOR"

This setup is likely part of a cloud or educational platform for practicing Docker commands.
