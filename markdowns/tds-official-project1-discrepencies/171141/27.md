Please correct me if Iâ€™m wrong, but I noticed that for tasks **B7**, **B8**, and **B10**, the evaluation log does not include any **`POST` or `GET` request traces**, unlike the other tasks which have clearly recorded request flows, generated code, and outputs. In these three cases, the log shows only the failure message without any indication that the script was executed or that the output file was read.

## Image Description

The image displays a snippet of code and console output related to an HTTP request and web scraping. It includes the following key elements:

- **HTTP Request:** 
  - POST method to the URL `http://localhost:8278/run` with various parameters for fetching quotes from famous authors.
  
- **Response Status:**
  - Status code `200` indicating success.
  - A JSON object confirming successful retrieval of quotes.

- **Error Messages:**
  - Several error messages indicating issues with the request and formatting, including:
    - "failed not all arguments converted during string formatting"
  
- **Tasks:**
  - A task is defined to download an image from a specified URL, resize it, and save it to a local path.

- **Additional Output:**
  - Messages like "GET request" confirming the URL accessed and corresponding status.

Overall, the image contains mixed content of code, JSON data, and console logs, highlighting both successful operations and encountered issues.
