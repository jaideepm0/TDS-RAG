Sir, how my git repo is not consistent i used the same repo which i have given you in the form even i did not commit any changes after 18th feb also in my docker file there is just a simple mistake that i forgot to add flask dependency just because of that mistake i am losing my marks. I also used same docker image which i have given you through form. Its my humble request please consider or give some solution. It felt like betrayal because we put effortâ€™s.
