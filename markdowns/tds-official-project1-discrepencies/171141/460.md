Thanks for the response [@carlton](/u/carlton) .. just a small suggestion, to avoid scenarios like what i faced and also with softwares like docker/podman not being too windows friendly, i think students can find it easier if a dev/mock linux env is provided for course term duration, instead of everyone having to figuring out with AWS/Azure and all providers.. Anyway thanks and appreciate all the help
