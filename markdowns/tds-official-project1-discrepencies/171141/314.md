Hi Hari,

I just *manually* checked your repo.

# Image Description

The image displays a 404 error page from GitHub. 

- **Background**: A light blue sky merges into a sandy beige foreground, resembling a beach.
- **Main Character**: A character wearing a brown, hooded outfit stands slightly to the right. The outfit has cat-like ears and a mischievous expression.
- **Text**: To the left of the character, there is a speech bubble containing the message: 
  - **"404"**: Large and prominently displayed at the top.
  - **"This is not the web page you are looking for."**: Written below the "404" in a clear, legible font.

Overall, the design is playful and colorful, typical of GitHub's whimsical style for error pages.

This is what *you* submitted:
