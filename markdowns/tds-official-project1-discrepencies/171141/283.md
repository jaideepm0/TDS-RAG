This is a common mistake many, many students made. They created a working application but not a working container.

```markdown
# Image Description

The image displays a GitHub repository interface.

## Repository Details
- **Repository Name:** tds-project1
- **User:** GaURaVinDeX
- **Commit Message:** Initial commit
- **File Count:** 23 lines (16 loc)
- **File Size:** 607 Bytes

## Dockerfile Section
The focus is on the `Dockerfile` in the `tds-project1` directory. The following key points are highlighted:

1. **Base Image:** Uses Python 3.12 slim version (`FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm`).
2. **Dependencies:** Installation commands for dependencies.
3. **Working Directory:** `WORKDIR /app` is set for the application directory.
4. **Copy Application Files:** `COPY app.py /app` indicates where to copy the application file.
5. **Command:** The last line specifies the command to run the application.

There is an arrow pointing to the line containing the `COPY app.py /app` command, indicating its importance in the context of setting up the Docker container.
```

  
You only copied `app.py` into your docker image.

How do you expect your application to run without the other files that your repo clearly shows is needed?

Thats why many people are failing this. Hope the image makes this clear.

Kind regards
