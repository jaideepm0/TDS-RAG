I have submitted my Project 1, and my GitHub repository meets all the listed requirements. However, I received a FAIL for the check:

“Is Dockerfile present in root of GitHub repo?”

Despite this, my dockerfile is present in the root directory of my repository.

Github repo link: [GitHub - karthiksirimilla/tds\_project1\_final](https://github.com/karthiksirimilla/tds_project1_final)

My evaluation.log , contains the score 6/20  
Roll no : 23f1002398

# Project 1 Scores

**Dear Learner,**

Project 1 requires you to pass some pre-requisite checks as detailed on the TDS Project 1 Evaluation page:

1. Your GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible.
2. Your GitHub repository has a LICENSE file with the MIT license.
3. Your GitHub repository has a valid Dockerfile.
4. Your Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via podman run -e 
   `AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 IMAGE_NAME`
5. Your Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in your GitHub repository.

If you fail to meet this minimum requirement, your submission will not get evaluated.

- Is GitHub repo present AND public: **PASS**
- Is Dockerfile present in root of GitHub repo: **FAIL** (MIT license present at root of GitHub repo)
