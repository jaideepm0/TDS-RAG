**Things i have done for my project to work locally:**

 carlton:

> `git clone <your repo url>`

cloned my repo which looked like this after cloning(ignore those green dots)  

```markdown
## Image Description

The image shows a code editor interface, likely Visual Studio Code. 

- **Project Name**: `TDS_PROJECT_1`
- **Folder**: `tds-project-1`
- **File**: `LICENSE` 
- **Status Indicator**: A green dot is present, indicating that the project is likely active or connected.

The layout features a vertical navigation panel on the left side, displaying the project and its contents.
```

All the files are in this folder (I wasn’t aware that we cannot have the subfolder in the root directory,I shouldn’t get penalized for this) and added the datagen and evaluate.py file.

 carlton:

> Keep datagen.py and evaluate.py in same folder

when i do this( ) i get this error

 carlton:

> `docker build -t <your image name>`

```
PS D:\TDS_Project_1\tds-project-1> docker build -t "tushar2k5/tds-project-1"                                                                 
ERROR: "docker buildx build" requires exactly 1 argument.
See 'docker buildx build --help'.

Usage:  docker buildx build [OPTIONS] PATH | URL | -

Start a build

```

Instead,in order to run the docker image successfully we have to do either of the two things(taken help from chatgpt ):  
1)

```
Use full path (recommended if you're outside the project folder):

docker build -t tushar2k5/tds-project-1 D:\TDS_Project_1\tds-project-1

```

**OR**  
2)

```
Add a dot (.) at the end to specify the current directory as the build context:

docker build -t tushar2k5/tds-project-1 .

```

*Both the things work for me*()

 carlton:

> `docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -P 8000:8000 <your image name>`

```
docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=i.am.still.noob.inTDS -p 8000:8000 tushar2k5/tds-project-1

```

Done this(can’t leak my token,already many students stolen it from my project-2🤦‍♂️)

 carlton:

> `uv run evaluate.py --email=<any email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000`

```
uv run evaluate.py --email=23f2003751@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000 

```

Done this to evaluate my project

Any finally the main part (DRUM ROLLS ,not this one  (IUKUK))

```markdown
## Image Description

The image displays a terminal interface with the following information:

- **Running Task**: 
  - It states the task as: "Does the statement 'I hate you' have a positive or negative connotation? Reply as a single string containing either 'POSITIVE' or 'NEGATIVE'. Save the result to /data/c5.txt."

- **Error Messages**:
  - Red error message: "C5 failed: Server disconnected without sending a response."
  - Another red message: "C5 FAILED"

- **Score**: 
  - Displays a score of "6 / 25".

- **HTTP Request**: 
  - Indicates an HTTP POST request to the URL: `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings` with the response: `"HTTP/1.1 200 OK"`.

The terminal background is dark, and the text is bright, which is typical for coding environments.
```

**THATS 6/25**

Currently I’m getting a big 0 beacause the github doen’t contain the dockerfile(which it does clearly)  

```markdown
# Pre-requisites Check

(1 for pass, 0 for fail)

- **Docker repo exists and is public** (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): **1**
- **Github repo exists and is public** (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): **1**
- **Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists** (MIT License): **1**
- **Github repo check - Dockerfile exists**: **0**
```
