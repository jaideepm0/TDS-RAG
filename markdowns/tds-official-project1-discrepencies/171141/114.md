My docker logs shows that `OSError: Cannot find resource` error occurred when the data generation script tried to access font files in generation for a8.

### Error Log

- **Installed Packages**: 3 packages installed in 42 ms.

    - `172.17.0.1:35176 - "POST /run?task=0&Install%60...&run+the+script+..."` (truncated for brevity)
```

The datagen.py script looked for Arial font in the try block and when it encountered error it went to the except block to use DejaVuSans, the Pillow default, except it encountered the same error there, which was not handled. Thus, datagen.py stopped abruptly without creating files for A9 and A10 as well. So effectively, my A9 and A10 did not get evaluated properly as it did not have the required files due to error during data generation for A8. Can you please re-evaluate by enclosing each of the data generation function calls in their own try-except blocks?

# Image Description

The image showcases a snippet of code displayed on a dark background. The code consists of several function names written in a programming syntax. Each function is displayed in yellow text, indicating a typical highlight for code elements. The functions are:

- `a2_format_markdown()`
- `a3_dates()`
- `a4_contacts()`
- `a5_logs()`
- `a6_docs()`
- `a7_email()`
- `a8_credit_card_image()`
- `a9_comments()`
- `a10_ticket_sales()`

This snippet appears to be part of a scripting or programming environment focused on data processing or management tasks.
```

  
I think it would be better to enclose each of these function calls in their own try-except blocks. This screenshot is taken from the datagen.py file sent in yesterday’s results mail.

So, will it be possible to re-evaluate my task A1, A8, A9 and A10? At least A9 and A10 did not even get the files to work on as they weren’t even created due to insufficient error handling in datagen.py .

Also, can you help me to identify the cause of even the Pillow default font not being available? I don’t understand how a font not being available could be caused by my code.

Thank you
