# Error Log Overview

The image displays a Google Sheets document titled `pf1_evaluation_error_logs`. The sheet contains a list of error messages related to various tasks and modules. Each row includes timestamps and error descriptions.

## Key Observations:
- **Common Error Messages:**
  - "task module missing"
  - "application missing on 5000 port"
  - "Pascall module missing"
  - "command not found"
  - "container was bound to 127.0.0.1 instead of 0.0.0.0 which is why docker container port 8000 is not accessible outside(host os)"
  
- **Time Stamps:** 
  Errors are categorized by their occurrence, indicated in the first column with date and time formats.

## Navigation:
- The top of the sheet includes typical document controls (e.g., File, Edit, Data).
- A navigation bar at the bottom shows the current position in the document (e.g., 22,101 of 524 entries).

This log appears to be a record of issues encountered in a software or application setting.

# Image Description

The image displays a file explorer window on a computer. 

## Key Features:

- **Location**: The current directory is "Downloads", specifically showing the folder "docker_logs.zip."
- **File**: There is one file visible, named "docker_logs.zip."
- **Search Bar**: At the top right, there is a search bar with the text "2317010342" entered, indicating a search query.
- **Content Area**: The main area of the window shows no items matching the search, as indicated by the message "No items match your search."
- **Navigation Pane**: The left side of the window contains a navigation pane with shortcuts to different folders such as "Desktop," "Pictures," "Videos," and "Back Up."

The overall layout is typical of a Windows file explorer interface.

# Image Description

The image displays a file management interface, likely from a Windows operating system. 

## Key Elements:
- **File Path**: The current directory is `Downloads/evaluation_logs.zip`.
- **Window Title**: `23H001534` is shown in the window title bar, which may refer to a project or file identifier.
- **Folders and Files Panel**: 
  - The left sidebar includes quick access to various folders: Home, Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Pictures, Music, and Videos.
  - The main area is mostly empty, displaying the message "No items match your search," indicating that there are no files currently visible or that a search did not produce any results.
  
## Additional Features:
- Various icons for actions (New, Sort, View) are visible at the top of the window, but no specific files or folders are listed in the main section. 

The overall interface appears to be a functional file explorer for managing downloads and compressed files.

I cannot find my docker\_logs nor evaluation\_logs and nor anything on the forms . The mail I got says that i received 0 in project tasks but clearly my project is not evaluated. Please look into this. during earlier evaluation i got 7 marks but this time it is 0.
