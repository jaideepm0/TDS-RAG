### Image Description

The image contains a snippet of text displayed in a programming or terminal context. 

- **Yellow Text**: Indicates a running task with a suggestion to install a package named `uv`. It includes a URL to a GitHub repository with a specific script.
  
- **HTTP Request Section**: Shows an HTTP POST request to `http://localhost:8503/run`, detailing the task and the associated arguments. It includes a link with a raw script.

- **Red Text**: Indicates an error message with an HTTP 500 status. It states: 
  - **Error**: "Agent error: 429 Client Error: Too Many Requests for url..."

This snippet reflects a technical error encountered during a request to a server, likely in a development environment.
```

this is a 429 from sanand which is an error from your side. The evaluation already so delayed now has such issues because of which I am getting 1/20. [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)
