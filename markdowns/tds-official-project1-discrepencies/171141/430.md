idk why i am doing this but this is my last request (for evaluation) with proofs. me and my friend both have same docker file code with missing flask dependency (i will try as much to not reveal his id/name) he got 12/20 even tough i tried same methods given by you and same error popped up flask module not found in his case but you gave him 12/20 marks but for me you gave 0? did i done something wrong? I know in industry level it matters much but right now we are students and for us CGPA matters. i am also uploading his docker file image and mine with 0 commits after 18th feb.
