# Error Traceback

The image displays a Python error traceback indicating a `KeyError`. The error occurs when the code attempts to access an environment variable named `AIRPROXY_TOKEN` that is not set.

## Details:

- **File:** `/app/app.py`
- **Line:** 30
- **Module:** `<module>`
- **Error:** KeyError: `'AIRPROXY_TOKEN'`

### Code Snippet:
```python
AIPROXY_TOKEN = os.environ['AIRPROXY_TOKEN']
```

### Additional Context:
- The traceback shows that the issue originated in the main script and propagated through the `os` module.
```

This is a screenshot of my docker log file. This works if you pass the actual value of the airproxy token at the command line while pulling the docker image. Please do look into this as Iâ€™ve put a lot of effort into this.

Thank you
