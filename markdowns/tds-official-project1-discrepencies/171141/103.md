- **Context of Error**: The error begins at `"/usr/local/bin/uvicorn"` and references several lines of code across various Python files.
- **Error Message**: The final lines specify a `KeyError`, indicating a missing key, specifically `USER_EMAIL`, in the environment variables.

## Key Error Details
- **KeyError**: `'USER_EMAIL'`
- **Trace Sequence**:
  - `File "/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/click/core.py", line 1161`
