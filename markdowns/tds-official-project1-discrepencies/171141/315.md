[@carlton](/u/carlton) sir When I submitted project 1, I was passing part A with 8/10 marks but today it is showing 0 marks on my email, but when I run it just now it is showing 4/10 on my vs code.  
Whereas when I download the file from GitHub and run it, it is showing 1/10 now.

# Image Description

The image displays a coding environment, specifically Visual Studio Code (VSCode). The following elements are highlighted:

- **File Explorer**: The left side shows an open file explorer with several Python files and a Dockerfile listed.
- **Open Editors**: A panel listing several currently open files, including `app.py`, `datagen.py`, and `evaluate.py`.
- **Code Editor**: The main central area reveals a Python script (`app.py`) with dependencies defined in a section. The dependencies include libraries such as `flask`, `requests`, and `pandas`.
  
- **Terminal Output**: At the bottom, there is a terminal output displaying:
  - An HTTP request response with status code `200 OK`.
  - A message indicating a task related to a SQLite database file located in `/data/ticket-sales.db`. 
  - The request endpoint is `http://localhost:8000/read/path/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt`.

- **Output**: It shows the results of the command execution with some numerical output and an indication of a failed check.

Overall, the image captures a snapshot of a programming workflow involving database queries and web server communication.

# Image Description

This image shows a laptop screen displaying a code editor, likely Visual Studio Code. 

## Key Elements:

- **Editor Context**: The file `task.py` is open in the editor, positioned on the left side, under a file explorer section.
- **Code Snippet**: The top section includes code written in Python, utilizing the `fastapi` library. It imports various modules and outlines HTTP responses.
- **Terminal Output**: Below the code, there's a terminal view showing an HTTP request. The request is made to a local server at `localhost`, attempting to retrieve data from `ticket-sales-gold.txt`.
- **Status Messages**:
  - A status message indicates a response of "HTTP/1.1 200 OK", but follows with "BAD FAILED", suggesting there may have been an error or unsuccessful operation.
- **File Path**: At the bottom of the terminal output, the file path indicates the project location, which is in the `C:\Users\username\Desktop\Projects\` directory.

## Visual Elements:

- The laptop is an HP model, displaying a light-colored keyboard and a white chassis.
- The taskbar at the bottom shows various open applications and system icons.

## Additional Notes:

- The overall environment indicates a coding or development scenario focused on web development using FastAPI.
