Hi @all

We will identify why arm images created a problem and were run using x86 platform.

We will also rerun evaluations for all the x86 and arm images one more time, before pushing to the dashboard.

> Hi [@jivraj](/u/jivraj),

[@23f3003302](/u/23f3003302) output from your server’s response is correct, we will update our evaluation script.

> ```markdown
# Image Description

The image displays a console output related to a data scraping operation. Key elements include:

- **HTTP Response:** 
  - Status code indicating success: `200 "scraped data saved to ./data/b6.json"`
  - Request URL: `GET http://localhost:8052/readpath/data/b6.json "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"`

- **File Path:** 
  - `/data/b6.json`

- **Expected Output:** 
  A list of authors, including:
  - Albert Einstein
  - J.K. Rowling
  - Albert Einstein (listed multiple times)
  - Jane Austen
  - Marilyn Monroe
  - André Gide
  - Thomas A. Edison
  - Eleanor Roosevelt
  - Steve Martin

- **Result Section:**
  A JSON object is structured with an authors key containing the expected list.

- **Error Message:** 
  - Indicated by a red "FAILED" message: `B6 FAILED`
```

[@23f2004912](/u/23f2004912) We will discuss internally if we can do something about it, but I can’t assure if you will get marks for it, since output from your server is a bit different.

[@HarshJaiswal](/u/harshjaiswal) I looked for your response for project1 docker image, and found out that we used correct image id. Here is repo information `harshjaiswal1/tds_project_final latest d0f14a872042 5 weeks ago 214MB`

This was submitted to us through google form, for project1.

 AYUSH\_SINGH:

> The 2 other log files i’m given doesnt have my email inside it listed.

We are aware about it results for 12 students are not generated, we will look into it, and see what caused those 12 images not to run.

> My evaluation log file is missing in report provided. It says tasksA was not found. but I have submitted tasksA in my project file. Also it says server didnt start for 5 mins but for me image was working fine. please kindly help me out. I have made submissions correctly.

It would have run at your end but it was supposed to run at anywhere, after dockerising it didn’t run, reason is taskA module was not found.
