You have a misspelling in your environment variable, thats why it failed. We do pass the token to your docker exactly as specified in Project 1 page.

## Error Traceback

The image displays a traceback from a Python application indicating an error in the code:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/app/app.py", line 30, in <module>
    AIPROXY_TOKEN = os.environ['AIRPROXY_TOKEN']
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "<frozen os>", line 716, in __getitem__
KeyError: 'AIRPROXY_TOKEN'
```

### Key Points
- The error occurs in the file `app.py` at line 30.
- The specific issue is a `KeyError` indicating that the environment variable `AIRPROXY_TOKEN` is not set.
```

Kind regards
