Given that you noticed an error on our side, you could have informed us about the same. However, you made your changes 22 hours ago, which is not acceptable.

```
tags = httpx.get(
                f"https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/{username}/{repo}/tags?ordering=last_updated",timeout = 60
            ).json()
            tag, size = next(
                (
                    (tag["name"], tag["full_size"])
                    for tag in tags.get("results", [])
                    if pd.Timestamp(tag["last_updated"]) <= DEADLINE
                ),
                (None, 0),
            )


```
