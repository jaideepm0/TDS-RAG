> Dockerfile has to be inside root of any github repo, this is standard and we had discussion with Professor Anand about such cases where it’s not part of root directory, he suggested we will consider only Dockerfile being present in root folder of the repo.

Sorry but its not possible to attend every single session and you guys haven’t informed us via email so how its our fault.For cases like this you guys should allow us to move our files to the root directory so it can work…(we just have to move files in the repo please consider it)[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)  
(i have already made a rookie mistake in my dockerfile otherwise i would have got 9/25 but keeping that aside please let me get 6/25)  
# Image Description

The image features an animated cat with a round face and large, expressive eyes. The cat has orange fur with lighter stripes. Its expression is one of pleading or innocence, evoking a sense of sympathy. Below the cat, the word "PLEASE" is prominently displayed in bold, white lettering, indicating a request or desire. The background appears to be a blurred green, suggesting an outdoor setting. ```markdown
The image depicts a character with white hair seated on a set of stairs, dressed in a black outfit. The character appears to be in a contemplative pose, resting their chin on one hand, while their other arm extends along the stair. The stairs are visually simple and have a warm tone, contrasting with the character's dark attire. The scene conveys a sense of stillness and introspection.
