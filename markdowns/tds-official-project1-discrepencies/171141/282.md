Sir,  
In the mail that i got about project 1 report. In the log file it was written as TasksA.py file not found in docker, which was the case i observed with many students.

```markdown
## Image Description

The image displays a terminal output showing the installation process of Python packages. Key points include:

- **Building and Downloading Packages**: 
  - Packages such as `antiorm`, `db`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `pydantic-core`, and `duckdb` are being downloaded and built.
  - Size information for each package is provided in parentheses.

- **Installed Packages**: 
  - A total of 33 packages were successfully installed in 56 milliseconds.

- **Error Message**: 
  - A traceback error is shown, indicating a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module named `taskA`, which occurs in the file `app.py` on line 22.

This output reflects typical output from a Python package installer in a coding environment.
```

This is my Github repo:

I built the image using docker build command in vs code terminal. And pushed it same way to dockerhub using docker push command. How is it possible that the docker container missed the TasksA.py file while building or pushing it?

After getting this mail, I ran the project locally again mutliple times just to check if there was any issues in the code. It was getting 9/10 test cases passed.
