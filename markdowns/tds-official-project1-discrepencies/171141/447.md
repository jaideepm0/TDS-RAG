**Subject:** Request for Verification of Dockerfile and Reevaluation of Marks for Project 1  
[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Sir,  
Regarding the recent feedback on **Project 1** for **TDS**, it was mentioned that there is no Dockerfile in my GitHub repo. However, the Dockerfile is named **`dockerfile`** (not **`Dockerfile`**). Please verify the repository again with this in mind.

Additionally, my Docker image architecture is *linux/amd64* (64-bit **x86**). I have also filled out the **Architecture Information Collector** form as requested.

**Pre-requisites check: (1 for pass, 0 for fail)**  
Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1  
Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1  
Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 1  
Gihub repo check - Dockerfile exists: 0  

# Image Description

The image displays a GitHub repository titled `task_agent_api`. It shows the main branch of the repository with the following features:

- **Navigation Bar**: At the top, there are typical GitHub navigation options such as `Code`, `Issues`, `Pull requests`, `Actions`, etc.
- **File List**: A list of files and folders in the repository is displayed. Each entry includes:
  - **File icon**: Denoting the type of file.
  - **File/folder name**: Some names include:
    - `README.md`
    - `app.py`
    - `requirements.txt`
    - `.env`
    - `dockerfile`
  - **Commit messages**: Next to each file, there are brief commit messages indicating the status (e.g., "initial commit" or "dockerfile update") along with timestamps (approximately 2 months ago for all entries).
- **About Section**: A brief section indicates there is "No description, website, or topics provided."
- **Sidebar**: On the right are sections labeled `Releases`, `Packages`, and `Contributors`, with notes on their statuses (e.g., "No releases published"). 

The overall layout follows the typical structure of a GitHub repository page, emphasizing organization and version control.
