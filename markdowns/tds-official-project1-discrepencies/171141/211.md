Hi [@thinkmachine](/u/thinkmachine) [@22f3002723](/u/22f3002723)

Since you updated docker repo few days ago and docker api doensâ€™t support timestamp based pulling we will pull your GitHub repo before 18 th feb and will build through it and run evaluations.

We also have your docker repo evaluation score, will discuss which one to keep.

This is for anyone who updated their docker repo and there are around 10-20 such cases
