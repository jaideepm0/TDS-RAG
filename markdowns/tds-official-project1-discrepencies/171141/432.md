Sir, in my docker logs, the datagen script encounters error during creating the credit card image for A8 during which it fails to find both the fonts used in the try and except blocks, resulting in the datagen script to stop abruptly without creating the files for A8 to A10.

```markdown
## Error Log Description

The image displays a traceback error log from a Python program. Key points include:

- **Context**: The program is attempting to generate an image, specifically a credit card image using the `PIL` (Python Imaging Library) package.
  
- **Error Messages**:
  - The error originates from file `a8_credit_card_image`, indicating an issue with font resources.
  - Multiple lines show attempts to load font files, with specific mentions of `arial.ttf` and `DejaVuSans.ttf`.
  - The primary error is an `OSError` stating `cannot open resource`, indicating that the specified font files cannot be found or accessed.

- **Traceback Information**: 
  - It provides recursion through different files and functions within the library, detailing where the error is encountered, which can help in diagnosing the issue.

This could be indicative of either missing font files or incorrect paths in the directory structure for the fonts.
```

I actually want to know if this could have been avoided by some changes in my code or is it an issue in the datagen.py script, because as the situation currently stands, my app wasn’t even tested properly for tasks A8 to A10 as the datagen.py script failed to create the required files because it could not find a font which as far as I knew was not specified that it must be included in my own code or image somehow.

Edit 1: I just realized that the datagen script looked for the fonts in python 3.13/site-packages/…  
But my docker image is using the python:3.12-slim-bookworm. Could that be an issue? There was nothing specified about required python version or required python image to be used in docker in the project 1 requirements.

Edit 2:  
Even if the font not being available is somehow my fault, A9 and A10 still should not be penalized for A8 without proper checking.

# Python Script Overview

This image displays a Python script intended for argument parsing and file management. Below is a brief description of its components:

## Script Functionality

- **Imports**: The script imports the `argparse` library to handle command-line arguments.
  
- **Argument Parsing**:
  - An `ArgumentParser` object is created.
  - It adds an argument for an email and a root directory with a default value of `/data`.

- **Configuration**: 
  - The email and root directory are stored into a `config` dictionary.

- **Directory Creation**: 
  - The script attempts to create a directory specified in the `config["root"]` path, allowing it to exist if it already does.

- **Output Messages**:
  - A disclaimer message indicating the script's potential changes before evaluation.
  - A message printing the location where files will be created.

## Function Calls

The script lists several function calls, suggesting further functionality related to:

1. Formatting markdown.
2. Managing dates.
3. Handling contacts.
4. Logging activities.
5. Email processing.
6. Managing documents.
7. Credit card image processing.
8. Comments handling.
9. Ticket sales management.

```

  
Though an error occured in A8, A9 and A10 still could have worked if each of these function calls were enclosed in their own try-except blocks, ensuring independent checks for each task. But the current datagen.py script fails as error propagates to main, where it is not handled and causes abnormal termination without executing the functions for creating files for A9 and A10 as well.

Thank you.
