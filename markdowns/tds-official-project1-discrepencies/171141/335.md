Good evening sir.

My original project evaluation conducted by IITM gave me 7/20, however the new evaluation gave me 0/20.

```markdown
# Log File Description

This log file appears to document the results of HTTP requests made during a data evaluation process. The following key points can be observed:

- **File Path:** `23f100223@ds.study.iitm.ac.in_evaluation.log`
- **HTTP Requests:**
  - A POST request was made to convert data from a specified URL. 
  - A GET request failed to read from the path `/data/b9.html`, resulting in a message that indicates the file could not be accessed.
  - Tasks related to running datasets were initiated with indications of failure in reading specific files:
    - **B9 Failed:** Cannot read `/data/b9.html`
    - **B10 Failed:** Cannot read `/data/b10.csv`
    
- **Error Messages:**
  - One of the HTTP requests resulted in a `400` error, with a detailed description regarding the inability to establish a connection.
  
- **Score:** 
  - The evaluation yielded a score of **7 out of 20**.

This log indicates issues with both data accessibility and connection problems during the evaluation process.
```

This was from the official evaluation sir, could you kindly look into it.
