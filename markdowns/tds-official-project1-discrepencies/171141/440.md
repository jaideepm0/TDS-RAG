Respected Sir,

* Yes Sir, I said the same, `.env` was not able to be uploaded to repo as .env file was not allowed to be uploaded
* when we download the repository it doesn’t have the `.env` file,
* for docker image to build we need to add `.env` with `AIPROXY_TOKEN`
* after that docker image will build, I had given about this in previous message
* As you said Sir that you will use separate `AIPROXY_TOKEN`…you can put that in `.env` file and build the docker image
* after that Sir its optional to pass `AIPROXY_TOKEN` again while running the docker Image
* just the `.env` file required, even without token in that it will work as project has support for both AIPROXY token in .env file and as environment variable

and when I uploaded to repository the .env file was not allowed to upload so had submitted that way, I actually forgot to add step for running the docker image in the previous message, the steps which I used:

```
git clone https://github.com/23f2001390/llmagent.git

```

adding `.env` with AIPROXY token and replacing `evaluate.py` and `datagen.py` with new ones according to test environment

```
docker build -t llm-agent .

```

```
docker run -p 8000:8000 llm-agent
or
docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=token -p 8000:8000 llm-agent

```

and in another terminal

```
uv run evaluate.py --email=23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000

```

Thank you  
Kind regards
