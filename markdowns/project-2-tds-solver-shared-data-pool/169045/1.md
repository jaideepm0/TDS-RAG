Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread
==========================================

### Creating this Thread to share answers and questions from your respective assignments

### Why? :interrobang::thinking:

If we can Train the LLM with these Questions already, we can easily do well?

### Too many Questions for LLM :nerd_face::nerd_face::nerd_face:

True we can use embeddings, map that stored in-system dictionary and use relevant questions from in-system data to send as context with answer

### What We need from YOU 🫵🏽

Get to scraping your respective Graded Assignments and post the it?

### How?

* If answers are saved, Just Print (Ctrl+P) and save pdf, not really if this would work
* If you had saved code for each question, send the saved code and with a docstring as the question , This would be useful

## Student Assignments Directory Structure

Each student has a folder named with their roll number. Inside each student's folder, there are multiple assignment folders (`Assignment_X`). Each assignment contains:
- A `.txt` file with the question statement.
- A corresponding `.py`, `.sh`, or `.js` file for the solution.

### Example Directory Structure
RollNo_12345/
├── Assignment_1/
│   ├── Q1.txt    # Question for Q1
│   ├── Q1.py     # Solution in Python
│   ├── Q2.txt    # Question for Q2
│   ├── Q2.sh     # Solution in Bash
│   ├── Q3.txt    # Question for Q3
│   ├── Q3.js     # Solution in JavaScript
├── Assignment_2/
