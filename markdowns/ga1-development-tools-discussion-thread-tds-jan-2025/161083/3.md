### Move and Rename Files (0.5 marks)

- **Task**: 
  - Download `q-move-rename-files.zip` and extract it.
  - Use the `mv` command to move all files from folders into an empty folder.
  - Rename all files by replacing each digit with the next (e.g., `a19b.txt` becomes `a20b.txt`).

- **Question**: 
  - What does running `grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` in bash on that folder show?
```

  
For question 16 of GA1, It says "Rename all files replacing each digit with the next "  
Accepted answer is working only if file names are renamed as  
2h3q9x.txt → 3h4q0x.txt  
eb209nmlca.txt → eb310nmlca.txt  
That means if digit is 9 then next digit should be 0. [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) let me know if this is what is expected. since 9->10 or 209 → 210 is not working
