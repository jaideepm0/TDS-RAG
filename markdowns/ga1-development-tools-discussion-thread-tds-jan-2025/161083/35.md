The same issue is happening in the question 12 of GA1. I have given the answer by using collab and gemini , its giving the proper result but showing wrong.  

# Image Description

The image consists of two main sections:

## Left Section
- **Content Type:** Code snippet displayed in a code editor.
- **Language:** The code appears to be written in Python.
- **Details:**
  - It includes file handling and encoding logic.
  - There are function definitions and loops present, suggesting operations on text or binary files.
  - A portion of the code handles exceptions, indicating some error handling practices.

## Right Section
- **Content Type:** Video thumbnail or a streaming window.
- **Visual Elements:**
  - A male presenter visible, wearing a plaid shirt.
  - The background includes text that reads "COMPUTER STUFF THEY DIDN'T TEACH YOU" alongside the title of the video.
- **Theme:** The video seems focused on computer science or programming education.

Overall, the image contrasts programming code with an educational video presentation.
