Q18 GA1
-------

I don’t get what’s wrong with this:  

```markdown
## Description of the Image

The image displays a section of a SQLite database table named `tickets`. This table includes the following columns:

- **type**: Represents the category of the ticket (e.g., Silver, Gold, Bronze).
- **units**: Indicates the quantity of tickets sold in each type.
- **price**: The price per ticket for each type.

### Data Overview

The table contains several rows, detailing ticket sales:

- **Silver**: 589 units at $1 each
- **Gold**: 559 units at $1.18 each
- **Gold**: 74 units at $1.03 each
- **Gold**: 361 units at $1.76 each
- **Bronze**: 673 units at $1.94 each

### SQL Query Example

At the bottom of the image, there is a SQL query intended to calculate the total sales for all items in the "Gold" ticket type, while also handling potential variations in casing for the type name. The query is as follows:

```sql
select sum(units * price)
from tickets
where type='gold' collate nocase;
```

An error message is displayed, indicating an issue with the SQL execution:
```
Error: Got [[129444.59]]
```

### Additional Notes

- It suggests to aggregate the sales as the product of `Units` and `Price` sums.
- The query emphasizes the importance of normalizing type entries to avoid case sensitivity issues.
```

Can anyone help me understand? Thanks
