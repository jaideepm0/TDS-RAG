# JSON Hash

The image displays a user interface for generating or displaying a JSON hash. 

## Features:
- **Title**: "JSON Hash" prominently displayed at the top.
- **Text Area**: Contains a long string of alphanumeric characters that appears to be a JSON hash.
- **Hash Button**: A button labeled "Hash" exists below the text area, indicating a function to process the JSON.
- **Error Message**: Below the button, there is a red error message stating: 
  ```
  Error: Expected property name or '}' in JSON at position 1 (line 1 column 2)
  ```
  This suggests a formatting error in the JSON data entered above.

## Color Scheme:
- The error message is highlighted in red for emphasis, while other elements maintain a standard interface design with neutral colors.

  
In the question 10 what should be the correct format for jason data as I edited the data according to given conditions but in Hash I am facing problem again and again

Also, in Q11 What is meaning of element below given in the question " Let’s make sure you know how to select elements using CSS selectors. Find all `<div>` s having a `foo` class in the hidden element below. What’s the sum of their `data-value` attributes?"
