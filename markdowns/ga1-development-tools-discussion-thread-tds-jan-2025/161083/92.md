# Image Description

The image displays a command-line interface (CLI) with a list of files and folders. The text appears to be output from a file management or terminal session. The display includes:

- Multiple entries of what seems to be file names, sizes, and possibly their modified timestamps.
- Additional instructions are visible at the bottom, suggesting a download procedure, including advice not to copy files directly from Windows Explorer.
- There is a section labeled "Don't copy from" with a cautionary note regarding file extraction, indicating instructions on how to handle files in a ZIP folder.

The overall layout is typical of a command prompt or terminal application, focused on file manipulation and management tasks.
