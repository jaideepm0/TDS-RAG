[@23f2005067](/u/23f2005067) [@23f2003751](/u/23f2003751) I added a “Recent saves” feature.

This will show the time and score for the last 3 times you saved. You can load from any of these.

# Recent Saves

- **Reload**
  - from 19/1/2025, 8:17:25 PM. Score: 1.25
- **Reload**
  - from 19/1/2025, 8:01:54 PM. Score: 0.25
- **Reload**
  - from 14/1/2025, 9:23:11 PM. Score: 0

Do remember to click the “Check” button to calculate your score. That is not automatic.

Please check this out and let me know if there are any bugs. Thanks.
