Hi [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir,

For me, in dashboard , it is showing the assignment was not submitted.

# Image Description

The image displays an online learning platform interface with the following details:

## Module Information
- **Module Title:** Development Tools

## Assignment Overview
- **Assignment Name:** Graded Assignment 1
- **Assessment Date:** Due on 26 January 2025
- **Your Score:** Not Submitted
- **Peer Average Score:** 99%
- **Median Score:** 100

## User Information
- **Logged-In User Email:** 22f3001740@ds.study.iitm.ac.in

## Recent Saves
A section titled **Recent Saves** includes three entries with the following details:
- **Entry 1:** Saved on 1/23/2025, 9:33:02 PM. Score: 8 (with a reload option)
- **Entry 2:** Saved on 1/23/2025, 9:32:59 PM. Score: 8 (with a reload option)

The entries are displayed in a light green box.

I havent answered the (yes / No ) in seek portal. If that might be a reason ?

Can you please help me resolve this issue
