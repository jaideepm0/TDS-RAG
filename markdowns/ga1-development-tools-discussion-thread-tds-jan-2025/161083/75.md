[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir,

Question 15 is under the section for linux

I got the file which needs to be processed to answer the question

```markdown
## File Directory Listing

| Length | Date       | Time   | Name      |
|--------|------------|--------|-----------|
| 4094   | 2004-03-10 | 07:49  | file0.txt |
| 8410   | 2007-02-11 | 18:46  | file1.txt |
| 8062   | 2000-01-26 | 13:40  | file2.txt |
| 9748   | 2010-09-27 | 00:34  | file3.txt |
```

I can solve this now using pandas.

From learning perspective, is this question aimed at making students to use something like awk or is it fine if i can carry on with pandas?
