## Image Description

The image displays a user interface for an assignment prompt. 

- **Title**: "Multi-cursor edits to convert to JSON (0.5 marks)"
- **Instructions**: The text instructs users to download a file named `q-multi-cursor.json.txt` and utilize a tool called `multi-cursor` to convert it into a JSON object by following specific formatting guidelines.
- **Question**: It asks for the result after pasting the JSON into a hashing tool found at "tools.in-data-science.pages.dev/joihash" and clicking the Hash button.
- **Error Message**: A red warning icon indicates that the provided answer is incorrect, accompanied by the specific hash code that was attempted.

The background is clean and primarily white, with highlighted text in red for emphasis on errors and instructions.
