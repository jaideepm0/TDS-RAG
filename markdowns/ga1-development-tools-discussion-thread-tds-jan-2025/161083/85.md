# Image Description

The image contains a text-based interface, likely a coding or command line environment.

## Section Details

- **Objective**: The task is to move and rename files, indicated by the following:
  - Download a file named `q_move-rename-files.zip` and extract its contents.
  - Use the command `mv` to move all files from subfolders into an empty folder.
  - Rename files by replacing digits with the next digit (e.g., 1 becomes 2, 2 becomes 3, etc.).

- **Question**: It asks what the command `grep . | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` in Bash will output when executed in the specified folder.

- **Text Box**: There is an input area showing a hash value:
  ```
  f{f105e67b343b1d78129f94c9a5bec4d53a82de2b131b87816808b7d *
  ```
  This box indicates that the submission was incorrect, prompting the user to try again.
```

  
Sir Iâ€™m facing issue in this question even though i have done every thing as it mentioned. Can I get hint of the mistake for my code snippet.  
My code: -

```
mkdir all_files
find parent/ -type f -exec mv {} all_files/ \;
for file in all_files/*; do
    new_name=$(echo "$file" | sed 's/[0-9]/\n&\n/g' | awk '
    { 
        if ($0 ~ /^[0-9]$/) print ($0 == "9") ? 0 : $0+1; 
        else print $0 
    }' | tr -d "\n")
    mv "$file" "$new_name"
done

```
