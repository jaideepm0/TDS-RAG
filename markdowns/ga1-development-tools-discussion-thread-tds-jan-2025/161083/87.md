I have another doubt regarding the CSS Selector question. I know how to select elements using CSS Selector but i don’t know how to get the sum using CSS Selectors as it cannot perform arithmetic operations. And also, I didn’t understand the question completely about the ‘hidden element’. Please clarify it. Thank you so much.

## Image Description

The image presents a user interface for a coding challenge related to CSS selectors. 

- **Text Content**: 
  - The instruction reads: "Let's make sure you know how to select elements using CSS selectors. Find all `<divs>` having a `foo` class in the hidden element below. What's the sum of their `data-value` attributes?"
  - There is a prompt for user input labeled "Sum of data-value attributes:" followed by an empty input field.
  - Below the input field, there is a message that says "Incorrect. Try again." displayed in red text.

- **Visual Style**: 
  - The background is dark-themed, possibly black or a very deep grey. 
  - The text is light-colored, enhancing readability against the dark background.
