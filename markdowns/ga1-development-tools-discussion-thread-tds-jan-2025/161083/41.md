Hi Jivraj,

I have tried with a different browser, but still not working. Below is the screenshot for your reference.  

```markdown
# Image Description

The image displays a browser error page with the following elements:

- **Background Color**: Dark gray.
- **Error Message**: "Your connection was interrupted" in large white font.
- **Sub-message**: "A network change was detected." in smaller white font below the main message.
- **Error Code**: "ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED" displayed below the sub-message.
- **Visual Element**: An animated character, resembling a small creature with a colorful head, is positioned at the top left.
- **Button**: A blue button labeled "Refresh" at the bottom of the page.

This layout suggests that the user has lost their internet connection and is prompted to refresh the page to try reconnecting.
```

Thanks
