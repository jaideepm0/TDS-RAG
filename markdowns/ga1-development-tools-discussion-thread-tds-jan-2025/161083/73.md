[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) Sir

as you said in the previous post, the evaluation script is also updated based on errors other students point out.

I am submitting my answers as soon as the GA is released and stopping once I get 10/10.

Will you reevaluate the answers once the deadline is over? Or the marks I see right now will be set in stone?

If you will, then it will be based on the updated evaluation script which can reduce my marks.
