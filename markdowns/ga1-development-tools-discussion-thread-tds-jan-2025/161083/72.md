If you are on Windows Powershell  
Then instead of `sha256sum` you can simply use `Get-FileHash`

Send the output of the `npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md` to a text file eg. `output.txt` and then use `Get-FileHash` on powershell with the `output.txt` and it will use sha256 by default and give you the exact same output.  
You might be able to pipe the data directly to `Get-FileHash` but I have not tried direct piping. The above method works guaranteed.

Kind regards
