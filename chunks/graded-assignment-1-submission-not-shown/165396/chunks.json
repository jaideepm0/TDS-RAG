Thanks [@23f2005471](/u/23f2005471)\n\nCorrect! Only scores that were saved in your actual last submission on the ga page itself will be evaluated (the portal question is just to make sure you were aware of the GA and confirm that you attempted it). Kind regards Respected Sir/Madam,\n\nI have submitted the TDS GA 1 assignment but failed to submit the Yes or NO option in the checkbox  \nI request you to please consider my submission as I have scored 6/10 marks in the assignment  \nand if you won’t my whole efforts will be lost just because of this  \n\n# Graded Assignment 1\n\n## Instructions\nIf you have any difficulty accessing the Graded Assignment, please check the following causes:\n1.

Ignore the seek Portal result (that was a placeholder question to make students aware that GA had been released). Kind regards I have done my GA1 and scored 10/10 still it’s showing 0 on my dashboard. # Image Description\n\n- The image displays a computer screen with an online exam interface. - The header indicates a due date: **Due Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST**. - It shows a **Score: 10/10** at the top right corner. - Below the score, there are options labeled **Check** and **Submit**. - The main content includes a SQL query:\n  ```sql\n  SELECT *\n  FROM Tickets\n  WHERE LOWER(TRIM(type)) = 'gold';\n  ```\n- The text mentions that the query is marked as **Correct**. - Additional instructions state: \"Get all rows where the Type is 'Gold'. Ignore spaces and treat mis-spellings like GOLD, gold, etc. as 'Gold'. Calculate the sales as Units.\" - There is a note indicating the submission will overwrite previous submissions and scores, with a reminder to save regularly. - The color scheme features a mix of green and blue for buttons and labels. ```markdown\n# IIT Madras - January 2025 TDS\n\n## Module 1: Development Tools\n\n### Graded Assignment 1\n- **Assessment Due:** 26 Jan 2025\n- **Status:** Submitted\n- **Your Score:** 100 !
