    "content": "Chat GPT has stepped up the game and I am excited \n\nNow I can not only generate the code, but can run it and ask it to fix the error with a single click. This changes software development and I guess we are moving in the direction we all know. It also makes this course a lot more important - the number of new things that I have learnt from this course which I am able to directly apply to my day to day work is immense. Thanks to [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) and the entire course team who designed this amazing course\n\nI hope ChatGPT solves deployment next \n\n```markdown\n# Image Description\n\nThe image displays a code editor interface, likely for a programming environment. ## Key Features in the Image:\n\n- **Title**: \"Wiki Outline Api\"\n- **Code Snippet**: \n  - The code outlines a function that fetches the Wikipedia page of a country and generates a Markdown outline. - The function constructs a Wikipedia URL, makes a request to fetch the page, and processes the HTML content using BeautifulSoup. - It extracts headings (from H1 to H6) from the page. - **Console Output**: \n  - There are several error messages displayed, indicating issues with module imports and potential misconfigurations in handling environments. - The final line indicates a successful execution of the 'Run' command. - **Left Panel**: Contains a chat or messaging interface with options for sending messages or adjusting settings. - **Dark Theme**: The overall aesthetic of the interface is in a dark mode, enhancing visibility. ## Context\nThe image appears to be focused on troubleshooting and refining code related to fetching and processing data from Wikipedia. ```"
