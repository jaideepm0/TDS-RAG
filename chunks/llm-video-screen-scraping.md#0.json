  "content": "## LLM Video Screen-Scraping\n\nVideo screen-scraping with LLMs is a powerful technique for extracting structured data from screen recordings. This approach works with any visible screen content and bypasses traditional web scraping limitations like authentication or anti-scraping measures. [! [Screen Scraping with Gemini](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/2G1LqS6qO5s/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/2G1LqS6qO5s)\n\nKey benefits:\n\n- No setup cost or authentication handling\n- Works with any visible screen content\n- Full control over data exposure\n- Extremely cost-effective (< $0.001 per short video)\n- Bypasses anti-scraping measures\n- Handles varying formats and layouts\n\n### Quick Start Example\n\nHere's a basic workflow using Google's AI Studio and Gemini:\n\n1. **Record the Screen**\n   - Use QuickTime (Mac) or Windows Game Bar (Windows), Screen2Gif, or any tool of your choice\n   - Select specific screen area containing target data\n   - Record scrolling/clicking through content\n   - Keep recordings short (30-60 seconds)\n2. **Process with Gemini**\n   - Upload to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/prompts)\n   - Select Gemini 1.5 Flash (cost-effective)\n   - Prompt for structured output (JSON/CSV)\n\nExample prompt for extracting tabular data:\n\n```text\nTurn this video into a JSON array where each item has:\n{\n  \"date\": \"yyyy-mm-dd\",\n  \"amount\": float\n}\n```\n\n### Cost Calculation\n\nGemini 1.5 Flash pricing (as of January 2025):\n\n- $0.075 per million tokens\n- Cost per frame ~ 250 tokens\n- Cost for 24 hours of video at 1 frame per second ~ $1.62! ### Best Practices\n\n1. **Recording Quality**\n   - Frame only relevant content\n   - Pause briefly on important data\n   - Maintain consistent scroll speed\n   - Use high contrast display settings\n2. **Data Validation**\n   - Always verify critical data manually\n   - Use spot-checking for large datasets\n   - Consider running multiple passes\n   - Log and review any anomalies\n3. **Error Handling**\n   - Request data in simple formats (CSV/JSON)\n   - Include validation in prompts\n   - Split long videos into segments\n   - Handle missing/partial data gracefully\n\n### Use Cases\n\n1. **Data Extraction**\n   - Email content aggregation\n   - Dashboard metrics collection\n   - Protected web content\n   - Legacy system data\n2. **Data Journalism**\n   - Public records analysis\n   - Time-series data collection\n   - Interactive visualization data\n   - Government website scraping\n3. **Business Intelligence**\n   - Competitor pricing analysis\n   - Market research data\n   - Internal system migration\n   - Legacy report conversion\n\nTools:\n\n- [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/prompts): Process videos with Gemini\n- [QuickTime Player](https://support.apple.com/guide/quicktime-player/welcome/mac): Screen recording (Mac)\n- [Screen2Gif](https://www.screentogif.com/): Screen recording (Windows)\n- [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/): Advanced screen recording (cross-platform)\n\nReferences:\n\n- [Simon Willison's Video Scraping Tutorial](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/17/video-scraping/)\n- [Gemini API Documentation](https://ai.google.dev/docs)"
