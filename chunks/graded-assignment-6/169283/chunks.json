It’s easier for us to copy-paste and test. Deadline 2025-03-15T18:30:00Z The answer choices for questions 1 and 2 in graded assignment 6 are quite confusing. Both questions are single-select, yet three out of the four options are correct in each case. I’m unsure whether to choose one of the correct options or if the question is actually asking for the incorrect one. Could someone please clarify? [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  \nI have similar concern  \nFor Q1, I used the following code:\n\n```\nprint(f'Pearson correlation for Karnataka between price retention and column')\nkk = df[df['State'] == 'Karnataka']\nfor col in ['Mileage (km/l)', 'Avg Daily Distance (km)', 'Engine Capacity (cc)']:\n    pearson_corr = kk['price_retention'].corr(kk[col])\n    print(f'\\t{col:25} : {pearson_corr:.2f}')\n\n```\n\nAnd got the following output:\n\n```\nPearson correlation for Karnataka between price retention and column\n\tMileage (km/l)            : 0.03\n\tAvg Daily Distance (km)   : -0.06\n\tEngine Capacity (cc)      : -0.04\n\n```\n\nWhereas options are below where none of them are correct. ```markdown\n## Image Description\n\nThe image displays a series of selectable options in a radio button format.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) Yeah…Even I am facing the same issue. Out of the 4 options provided, 3 options are correct in my case both for Q1 & Q2, but both these questions are single-choice questions. Kindly look into it and help us out [@carlton](/u/carlton) ! I guess for both Q1 & Q2, we need to find the option that is having stronger correlation (positive/negative). Please correct me if I am wrong. Any updates on these? I am too facing the same issue. [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) In GA6 for first 2 questions 3 out of 4 options are correct. Even the question is not clearly asking anything. Kindly suggest are we supposed to select the wrong one  \n\n# Image Description\n\nThe image contains a questionnaire item related to a strategic consulting task for a premium motorcycle dealership chain in Maharashtra. It emphasizes the analysis of factors influencing motorcycle resale value, particularly for Yamaha. Key points include:\n\n- **Objective**: Evaluate the impact of:\n  - Mileage (km/l)\n  - Average distance traveled\n  - Engine capacity\n- **Methodology**: Use the Pearson Correlation Coefficient for analysis, where price retention is defined as (resale price / original price). ### Multiple Choice Options:\n1. `AvgDistance: 0.09`\n2. `Mileage: 0.95` (selected)\n3. `EngineCapacity: -0.02`\n4. `Mileage: 0.12` Kindly update us regarding the status of Q1 & Q2 [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh\\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  \nDear TDS Team,\n\nThere are multiple issues in Graded Assignment 6 that require urgent attention:\n\n1. Questions 1 and 2, along with their options, are ambiguous. 2. In Questions 3 and 4, I am unable to obtain an exact answer that matches any of the given options, despite trying multiple approaches, including the Excel regression method and other models in a Google Colab file. 3. The data for Question 10 is missing. I attempted to run the shapefile in QGIS, but it resulted in an error. Additionally, I searched for the shapefile of New York roads on official websites, but their servers are currently under maintenance. The assignment deadline is approaching, but these issues remain unresolved. Kindly look into this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution as soon as possible. Thank you for your support. Yes, there are no specifics in Q1 to Q4 and are quite ambiguous. For instance:\n\n> forecast the 2027 resale value of the Hero - HF Deluxe in Gujarat, using historical data. but is this talking about the average resale value as no input features are specified? Let’s wait for their response. I submitted nearby option for Q3 and Q4 [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh\\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  \nCan you please provide any update ASAP as the deadline for this GA coincides with Quiz 2. With many ambiguities unresolved it’s hard to solve this and study for Quiz 2 (and do offline college work even though that’s not your problem). Thanks Hi @all\n\nQuestion intends you to select most correlated one. Select option which is absolute highest. [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) - Can you please check answer choices for Q7 for GA6 where no choices are matching with the answer. The answer is coming to around 11.5 kms which is 11500 meters. Q.A wildfire is threatening a rural mountain region, and emergency services need to coordinate evacuation routes for four remote communities. The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Pine Pines Junction : (26.5596,-99.5336) ;Maple Fields Station : (26.4212,-99.4597);South Glen Crossing : (26.5962,-99.5243);Cedar Creek Retreat : (26.56,-99.4519) & Central Command Post Location: (26.4644,-99.4771) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Pine Pines Junction.

Several options with correlation values are listed:\n- **AvgDistance**: -0.04\n- **AvgDistance**: 0.95\n- **EngineCapacity**: -0.04\n- **Mileage**: -0.04 (selected option)\n```\n\n  \nwhat to do if 3 options have same value -0.04 and all are correct? [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  \nMy question 7 for GA6 is :  \nA wildfire is threatening a rural mountain region, and emergency services need to coordinate evacuation routes for four remote communities. The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant Harbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit Shores Village : (42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836) & Central Command Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs Community.

It seems to have some error. [@lakshaygarg654](/u/lakshaygarg654) No,  \nI use google to get MTFCC code for given road segment and after that mtfcc pdf to classify that road segment. I downloaded the complete shape file zip from the [census.gov](http://census.gov) site. Here is the link: <https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2024/PRISECROADS/tl_2024_36_prisecroads.zip>\n\nIt works fine in QGIS. [@lakshaygarg654](/u/lakshaygarg654) they have not provide all the files needed to read that shp file in the question . but your link includes them. thanks… I tried to access shapefile from official website 4-5 days ago, but server was under maintenance.

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  \nFor 7th Question in GA6 I got the answer 14265.9275 Meters but the option I have in 7th are  \n6069 meters  \n7687 meters  \n6106 meters  \n7035 meters Hello Sir,\n\nCan you please check if this is the right answer. As per email received from [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir we should select the absolute maximum value. ```markdown\n# Image Description\n\nThe image contains a questionnaire designed for a strategic consultant in the context of a premium motorcycle dealership chain. It focuses on analyzing factors influencing motorcycle resale value in Uttar Pradesh. Key elements include:\n\n1. **Objective**: Analyze the impact of various factors on motorcycle resale value. 2. **Factors Listed**:\n   - Mileage: 0.01\n   - Engine Capacity: 0.95\n   - Average Distance: -0.13\n   - Engine Capacity (another mention): 0.09\n3. **Output**: The question states that a specific answer is incorrect, with a score of 0 being displayed. 4. **Accepted Answers**: The correct answer is indicated as 'EngineCapacity: 0.09'. The layout is straightforward, using checkboxes for various options and a clear instruction narrative. ```\n\nExample : If we get answers as -0.3 and 0.2 then -0.3 is the right answer as it’s absolut value is maximum. For the first question the correlation matrix is as follows,  \n\n```markdown\n# Correlation Matrix\n\nThe image shows a correlation matrix displayed as a heatmap, representing the relationships between various numeric variables related to vehicles. The variables include:\n\n- **Mileage (km/l)**\n- **Avg Daily Distance (km)**\n- **Engine Capacity (cc)**\n- **Price Retention (%)**\n\n## Correlation Values\n\nThe values in the matrix indicate the strength and direction of the correlation between the pairs of variables, ranging from -1 to 1:\n\n- **1.00** denotes a perfect positive correlation. - **0.00** indicates no correlation. - **-1.00** indicates a perfect negative correlation. ### Notable correlations:\n\n- **Engine Capacity (cc) and Price Retention (%)**: Strong positive correlation (0.09). - **Avg Daily Distance (km) and Price Retention (%)**: Weak negative correlation (-0.13). - **Mileage (km/l) and Engine Capacity (cc)**: Weak positive correlation (0.04). - **Mileage (km/l) and Price Retention (%)**: Weak positive correlation (0.01). ## Color Gradient\n\nThe color scheme ranges from dark blue (negative correlation) to dark red (positive correlation), with the values highlighted in corresponding shades. ```\n\nSo shouldn’t it be -0.13? Thanks for the colour picture. If you read the aforementioned email…  \n\n# Email Summary\n\n**Subject:** [TDS Jan 25] GA 6 Clarification\n\n**From:** donot_reply@study.iitm.ac.in  \n**To:** 25t1_se2002-announce Thank you sir. i have got questions 1 and 2 both marked as 0. ```markdown\n## Image Description\n\nThe image depicts a question related to a strategic analysis for a premium motorcycle dealership chain in Maharashtra. The text outlines the objective of evaluating factors that influence motorcycle resale value, emphasizing three specific metrics:\n\n1. **Mileage (km/l)** \n2. **Average Daily Distance Traveled**\n3. **Engine Capacity**\n\nThe question prompts the evaluation of these factors using Pearson Correlation Coefficient to assess their impact on price retention (calculated as resale price/original price). In the answer options, the following values are given:\n\n- **AvgDistance:** 0.01\n- **Mileage:** 0.03\n- **EngineCapacity:** -0.06\n- **Mileage:** 0.95\n\nIt indicates that the initial provided answer is incorrect, stating a score of 0. The correct answer is highlighted as **'Mileage: 0.03'**. ```\n\nIn my case Please note the above two questions are asked to calculate pearson correlation coefficient for KTM brand and for maharashtra and Karnataka states. I have used excel to calculate the pearson correlation coefficient. Below the values I got for each question. Please verify. |pearson correlation coefficient between impact of Mileage and Price retention for kTM brand for Karnataka||  \n-0.026685695\n\n|pearson correlation coefficient between average distance travelled and Price retention for kTM for karnataka||  \n0.003953219\n\n|pearson correlation coefficient between average Engine capacity and Price retention for kTM for karnataka||  \n-0.010839295\n\n|pearson correlation coefficient between impact of Mileage and Price retention for kTM brand for maharashta||  \n0.029128825\n\n|pearson correlation coefficient between average distance travelled and Price retention for kTM for Maharashtra||  \n0.013019585\n\n|pearson correlation coefficient between average Engine capacity and Price retention for kTM for Maharashtra||  \n-0.056866212 [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)  \nDear sirs,  \nI have question no 7 got marked as 0. Please check the question below and the haversine distance for the given post comes to around 11.5 kms which is not matccing with any of the options and I have selected the closest answer. please check and let me know. ```markdown\n### Image Description\n\nThe image presents a question related to calculating distances using the Haversine formula, set against the backdrop of a wildfire threatening a rural mountain region. #### Key Details:\n- **Scenario**: Emergency Management Center coordinating evacuation routes due to a wildfire. - **Communities Mentioned**:\n  - Pine Pines Junction: Coordinates (25.5596, -99.5336)\n  - Maple Fields Station: Coordinates (26.4212, -99.4597)\n  - South Glen Crossing: Coordinates (26.5962, -99.5243)\n  - Cedar Creek Retreat: Coordinates (26.56, -99.4519)\n  - Central Command Post: Coordinates (26.4644, -99.4771)\n\n#### Question:\n- \"Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Pine Pines Junction. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance?\" #### Answer Choices:\n- 3848 meters\n- 6265 meters\n- 4110 meters\n- 5106 meters\n\n#### Additional Note:\n- The submitted answer was marked incorrect with a notification indicating the correct answer is 5106 meters, and a score of 0 was recorded. ``` [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  \nI did raise the question 2 days before the GA6 Deadline and doing so again after being marked as incorrect\n\nMy question 7 was A wildfire is threatening a rural mountain region, and emergency services need to coordinate evacuation routes for four remote communities. The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant Harbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit Shores Village : (42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836) & Central Command Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs Community. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance\n\n10418 meters\n\n12287 meters\n\n10965 meters\n\n11149 meters\n\nWhose right answer turned out 6873, however the answer pushed is 12287 meters, which is nowhere near the closest options (it would’ve been correct if the destination was summit shores village which isn’t the case with this question)\n\nAlso, my question 4 was :  \nAs an investment analyst monitoring motorcycle resale values, develop a forecasting model to predict future resale prices by brand and segment, considering seasonality and long-term trends. Specifically, forecast the 2027 resale value of the Kawasaki - Ninja 300 in Tamil Nadu, using historical data. 134483\n\n94774\n\n150666\n\n199711\n\nWhose correct option (through different methods and algorithms) was approximately closest to 94774 and again answer pushed is 150666 which again turns out to be incorrect\n\nSo is the case with questions 1 and 2 (where answers aren’t pushed according to absolute values, but as conveyed earlier, I believe this shall be resolved)\n\nKindly look into it\n\nThanks and Regards [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  \nIn Q4 , neither which regression model to use is given nor the what random state to use is given. I tried linear regression, random forest regression but it is giving answer which vary each time I compute, also, the option values are quite close. ```markdown\n### Image Description\n\nThe image presents a question related to motorcycle resale value forecasting. It is structured as follows:\n\n- **Question**: An investment analyst is tasked with developing a forecasting model to predict future resale prices by brand and segment for the Hero - HF Deluxe in Punjab, using historical data. - **Options**:\n  - 194515\n  - 185108\n  - 142646 (selected)\n  - 152609\n\n- **Feedback**: The answer selected (142646) is marked as incorrect. - **Score**: 0\n\nThe design is typically used for quizzes or assessments, indicating the selection and correctness of responses. ``` @all  \nwe are looking into problems with question 4, 6 and 10. Hi,\n\nHave the corrections been done on GA6 marks? Yes, corrections have been done in Ga6 marks. Just to confirm, were the answers shown on the portal correct because I’m getting the same score as shown in the portal."
