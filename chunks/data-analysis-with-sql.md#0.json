[Data Analysis with Databases](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Xn3QkYrThbI/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/Xn3QkYrThbI)\n\nYou'll learn how to perform data analysis using SQL (via Python), covering:\n\n- **Database Connection**: How to connect to a MySQL database using SQLAlchemy and Pandas. - **SQL Queries**: Execute SQL queries directly from a Python environment to retrieve and analyze data. - **Counting Rows**: Use SQL to count the number of rows in a table. - **User Activity Analysis**: Query and identify top users by post count. - **Post Concentration**: Determine if a small percentage of users contribute the majority of posts using SQL aggregation. - **Correlation Calculation**: Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between user attributes such as age and reputation. - **Regression Analysis**: Compute the regression slope to understand the relationship between views and reputation. - **Handling Large Data**: Perform calculations on large datasets by fetching aggregated values from the database rather than entire datasets. - **Statistical Analysis in SQL**: Use SQL as a tool for statistical analysis, demonstrating its power beyond simple data retrieval. - **Leveraging AI**: Use ChatGPT to generate SQL queries and Python code, enhancing productivity and accuracy.
