Yeah they said you can take help anyway possible even to ask a cat also or a pet, im not sure Alright, works. I am down to collaborate. Asking help is different from sharing answers in a public forum. I don’t think they will permit this. Sharing answers is asking for help If the ROE is like how it was for MOCK ROE1 then this probably wont work right? Only for today’s ROE(mock 2) we can split the tasks efficiently and get it done. Thoughts? trebhuvansb:\n\n> Asking help is different from sharing answers in a public forum. I don’t think they will permit this. this is valid. should we just ask them? Could u message a TA? Yeah thats the idea… [What's the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam? ](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/whats-the-actual-purpose-of-impossible-roe-exam/99838/2) [Tools in Data Science](/c/courses/tds-kb/34)\n\n> [@ankit.jain](/u/ankit.jain) – I’m the culprit behind this RoE structure.

Implicit learning. > Implicit learning is “How much can they answer if woken up from sleep?”\n> Explicit learning is “How much can they answer given time and Internet?”\n> Some may know 10% implicitly. Some know 50%. They’ll answer those in a few seconds. > Some, they can FIND out. with Google, StackOverflow, ChatGPT. That’s explicit learning. But it takes time… Their whole concept of implicit learning disappears when people start sharing answers in a public forum. [On another topic](/t/99838/2)\n\n> et? read the post, its about explicit learning xD  \nEDIT its implicit my bad ! off topic, how do you dm people on discourse? So, are we using this thread, or should we make a Google space or something? I created a discord\n\n# Image Description\n\nThe image features a circular logo with a blue background. In the center, there is a stylized white graphic resembling a cartoonish face. The face has two circular eyes and a curved line representing a smile, giving it a friendly appearance. The overall design is simple and modern, characteristic of digital platforms.
