    "content": "Mock Exam: Tools in Data Science\n================================\n\n#### The end term and the mock has been created using the TDS GPT Assistant. Since the GPT has ALL the GAs, Course Content Modules, Live Session Transcriptions (its works like RAG), it is really able to help you prepare for the end term. Use it! Therefore you can also create your own mocks. ```markdown\n## Image Description\n\nThe image features a stylized logo consisting of intertwined shapes, resembling an abstract representation of interconnected loops or a knot. It is designed in a minimalist style and is predominantly black and white. The logo appears to convey a sense of unity and complexity, with geometric elements forming a cohesive symbol. ```\n[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-mZqKVxKDx-iitm-tds-teaching-assistant)\n\n### [ChatGPT - IITM TDS Teaching Assistant](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-mZqKVxKDx-iitm-tds-teaching-assistant)\n\nTA for IIT Madras' Data Science course, guiding students with questions. Below are variant questions across various topics relevant to the course. These questions have been curated from the topics areas we are focussing on. Therefore it will be very similar in content to the end term. > What it does not contain: Scenario based questions. These are complex to construct. We will address the topics for these questions in the live session. * LLMs\n* Pandas\n* Git, Docker, Bash\n\n\n### Module: Everyday Tools\n\n**Q1: Spreadsheet Functions**\n\nYou have a dataset in Excel where column A contains full names in the format “Last Name, First Name”. Which function can you use to extract the first name into a separate column? * A. `=LEFT(A1, FIND(\",\", A1)-1)`\n* B. `=RIGHT(A1, LEN(A1) - FIND(\",\", A1))`\n* C. `=MID(A1, FIND(\",\", A1)+2, LEN(A1))`\n* D. `=SPLIT(A1, \",\")`\n\n**Answer**: C — The `MID` function extracts text from the middle of a string. By finding the position of the comma and adding 2 (to skip the comma and space), it extracts the first name. Option A extracts the last name, Option B results in an error due to incorrect syntax, and Option D is not a valid Excel function. ### Module: Data Preparation\n\n**Q3: Handling Missing Data**\n\nIn a dataset, you notice that several entries in the “Age” column are missing. Which method is generally **not** appropriate for handling these missing values? * A. Replacing missing values with the mean age. * B. Deleting rows with missing age values. * C. Replacing missing values with a fixed age, such as 0. * D. Leaving the missing values as they are without any action. **Answer**: D — Leaving missing values unaddressed can lead to errors in analysis and modeling. Options A, B, and C are common strategies for handling missing data, depending on the context and the extent of the missingness. ### Module: Large Language Models\n\n**Q5: Tokenization in NLP**\n\nIn Natural Language Processing, what is the primary purpose of tokenization? * A. To translate text from one language to another. * B. To split text into individual words or subwords. * C. To encrypt text for secure communication. * D. To summarize large texts into shorter versions. **Answer**: B — Tokenization involves breaking down text into smaller components, such as words or subwords, which can then be processed by language models. This is a fundamental step in NLP tasks. ### Module: Data Visualization\n\n**Q7: Effective Data Visualization**\n\nWhen creating a bar chart to compare the sales performance of different products, which practice should be avoided? * A. Ordering bars from highest to lowest value. * B. Using different colors for each bar without a legend. * C. Starting the y-axis at zero. * D. Labeling each bar with its exact value. **Answer**: B — Using different colors for each bar without a legend can confuse the audience, as they may assume the colors represent different categories. Consistency and clarity are key in effective data visualization. ### Module: Data Sourcing\n\n**Q9: Data API Identification**\n\nWhich of the following data sources is most likely to provide structured data accessible via an API? * A. A scanned PDF document\n* B. A screenshot of a chart\n* C. **The World Bank data portal**\n* D. A newspaper article\n\n**Answer**: C — The World Bank data portal provides structured datasets accessible via APIs. The other options involve unstructured or image-based content not suitable for direct data access. ### Module: Data Analysis\n\n**Q11: Outlier Detection**\n\nYou are analyzing a dataset of employee salaries. Which visualization is best for quickly identifying outliers? * A. Line chart\n* B. **Box plot**\n* C. Histogram\n* D. Pie chart\n\n**Answer**: B — A box plot clearly shows the spread of data and highlights outliers as individual points beyond the whiskers. ### Module: Geospatial and Network Analysis\n\n**Q13: Network Centrality**\n\nIn a social network graph of coworkers, which metric best identifies the person who connects the most groups together? * A. Degree centrality\n* B. Closeness centrality\n* C. **Betweenness centrality**\n* D. Eigenvector centrality\n\n**Answer**: C — Betweenness centrality measures how often a node appears on shortest paths between other nodes, highlighting connectors or “bridges” in the network.
