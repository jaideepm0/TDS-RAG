Please use markdown code formatting (fenced code blocks) when sharing code (rather than screenshots). It’s easier for us to copy-paste and test. Deadline: 2025-02-15T18:30:00Z\n\n[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@carlton](/u/carlton) # Image Description\n\nThe image appears to be a screenshot of a web application related to an examination or educational platform. ## Key Components:\n- **User Status**: \n  - Displays a message indicating the user is logged in as \"23f10026300@std.study.iitm.ac.in\". - A \"Logout\" button is present. - **Sections**:\n  - **Recent Saves**: \n    - A section titled \"Recent saves\" which states \"No recent saves\". - **Loading Section**: \n    - A progress indicator or message labeled \"Loading questions...\". - **Error Message** (highlighted in red): \n    - States, \"Error! Sorry, we couldn't load the questions. That's strange. Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '1').\" - Includes a prompt to \"Please contact the exam team for assistance.\" ## Visual Design:\n- The background is dark, with various sections highlighted in contrasting colors (green, blue, and red) to indicate different states (normal and error). i can’t load my questions [@23f1002630](/u/23f1002630) - thanks for raising this. It’s fixed and won’t re-occur for anyone. **What happened? ** I picked random duration from the video of 10-40 seconds, but forgot to ensure that the end time should not exceed the video length. That’s what I fixed. ```markdown\n## Image Description\n\nThe image displays a user interface related to an exam or assessment platform. It features the following components:\n\n1. **Recent Saves Section**: \n   - A dark green box indicating no recent saves and stating that this is the official score. 2. **Loading Section**: \n   - A blue box with a loading spinner and the text \"Loading questions...\". 3. **Error Message**: \n   - A dark red box containing an error message:\n     - \"Error! Sorry, we couldn't load the questions: That's strange.\" - Additional technical details: \"cannot read properties of undefined (reading '1')\"\n     - A prompt for assistance: \"Please contact the exam team for assistance.\" 4. **Buttons**:\n   - Two buttons at the bottom:\n     - \"Check all\" (in green)\n     - \"Save\" (in blue)\n\nThe overall theme of the interface is dark, likely designed for easy reading in low-light environments. ```\n\n  \nIt was solved but again I’m facing the same issue [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) I’m still facing the issue. i guess there’s some issue in 5th question as i have correctly filtered the data in OpenRefine 2-3 times but still getting incorrect in the portal. OpenRefine question has historically been a tricky question to get right. Check out some past TA sessions in previous term for solving it, or previous discourse posts.

Update: I tried for both (thank god for filters in Excel) and Sunday is what the question is asking for. The Instruction above for “Saturday” is incorrect- maybe the logic generating different questions for different students can be tweaked-\n\nThank you I’ve attempted this question several times and I’m fairly certain that the answer to this question is incorrect. I’d be grateful if the answer to this question was re-checked. I can share the answer I’m certain about here, however I do not think it would be prudent to do so given this is a public forum. Please consider my request and double check-\n\n[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj), [@carlton](/u/carlton)\n\nThank you\n\n# Case Study: Recovering Sales Data for ReceiptRevive Analytics\n\n**ReceiptRevive Analytics** is a data recovery and business intelligence firm specializing in processing legacy sales data from paper receipts. Many of the client companies have archives of receipts from past years, which have been digitized using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) techniques. However, due to issues like faded or partially damaged receipts, the OCR process sometimes produces incomplete JSON data. These imperfections can lead to truncated fields or missing values, complicating the process of data aggregation and analysis. ## Company Overview\n\nOne of ReceiptRevive's major clients, **RetailFlow Inc.**, operates numerous brick-and-mortar stores and has an extensive archive of old receipts. RetailFlow Inc. needs to recover sales data, which is essential for the digitized receipts to analyze historical sales performance. The provided JSON data contains 100 rows, with each row representing a sales entry. Each entry is expected to contain four keys:\n\n- **city**: The city where the sale was made. - **product**: The product that was sold. - **sales**: The number of units sold or sales revenue. - **id**: A unique identifier for the sales record. Due to damage to some receipts during the digitization process, the JSON entries are truncated at the end, and the **id** field is missing. Despite this, RetailFlow Inc. is primarily interested in the aggregate sales value. ## Your Task\n\nAs a data recovery analyst at ReceiptRevive Analytics, your task is to develop a program that will:\n\n1. **Parse the Sales Data**: Read the provided JSON file containing 100 rows of sales data. Despite the truncated data (specifically the missing **id**), you must accurately extract the **sales** figures. 2. **Data Validation and Cleanup**: \n   - Ensure that the data is properly handled even if some fields are incomplete.

Try again and check your step. Otherwise go and watch 18-Feb Live Session [@Saransh\\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  \nQ5 fixed, thanks for fixing the issue. Now we are struggling with Q8. MY q8 is : Write a DuckDB SQL query to find all posts IDs after 2025-01-09T12:36:14.085Z with at least 1 comment with 4 useful stars, sorted. The result should be a table with a single column called `post_id` , and the relevant post IDs should be sorted in ascending order. when i use below query, i get some some result, a table of post\\_id but error : **Error**: At root: Array length mismatch  \n**Reason**: below query checking only 1st comment (`$[0]` refers to the first comment in the array) we have to check all comments not 1st. But when i change the query to check any one comment its giving different types of error. ```\nWITH filtered_posts AS (\n  SELECT post_id\n  FROM social_media\n  WHERE timestamp >= '2025-01-09T09:48:01.303Z'\n    AND EXISTS (\n      SELECT 1\n      FROM social_media AS sm\n      WHERE json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') IS NOT NULL\n        AND CAST(json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') AS INTEGER) > 4\n    )\n)\nSELECT post_id\nFROM filtered_posts\nORDER BY post_id ASC;\n\n```\n\nKindly check if any issue with Q8. May be my query is wrong or may be not. Thankyou [@lakshaygarg654](/u/lakshaygarg654)\n\nYour query construction is unnecessarily complicated and therefore will be difficult to debug. Query construction is best done by thinking what you want at the end. In this case its an ordered `post_id`\n\nSo thats where you begin:\n\n```\nSELECT post_id\nFROM (\n...\n)\nORDER BY post_id\n\n```\n\nDoing this, produces the actual result without giving the logic yet. Then at each stage you add the next stage of complexity. You will still need the `post_id` for the *outermost layer* so you have to continue extracting it from the *inner layers* of the nested query. ```\n...\n...\nFROM (\n   SELECT post_id, ( ... ) as max_stars\n   FROM social_media\n   WHERE time_stamp >= (whatever the parameter you have been given)\n      AND max_stars >= (whatever the parameter for min stars you have been given)\n)\n...\n...\n\n```\n\nThen the final layer of the nest\n\n```\n...\n...\n(\n\n) as max_stars\n...\n...\n\n```\n\nYou are not expecting me to solve the whole question right? (Hint: the inner most extraction involves JSON or “structure” extraction, which is a powerful capability)\n\nBut I hope you understand the logic of SQL which is a very elegant set theory language which is why it has lasted for over 4 decades. Think clearly at each stage what do you need. Start with the answer and work backwards, extracting at each stage the logical items you require for the outer layer to be functional. Kind regards Its been done. You will get a more detailed error now. And we have relaxed the number of errors allowed (it actually did have a tolerance limit but it was fairly tight) sir even after applying this logic im getting error at root: array length mismatch [@daksh76](/u/daksh76) thats because your innermost logic layer must not return a long list of results. If you think about it logically each row cannot have a column field where one of the columns is a whole row of results right? Thats why you are getting the error. Check your innermost layer is returning a single value or a row of results. Kind regards Thank you for your response [@carlton](/u/carlton). You are absolutely right—my query was unnecessarily complex. Initially, I attempted a simpler approach, using various JSON extraction functions. However, I encountered multiple errors, including:\n\n1. **`json_extract`**: *“Table Function with name ‘json\\_extract’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”*\n2. **`json_each`**: *“Table Function with name ‘json\\_each’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”*\n3. **`json_extract_path_text`**: *“Table Function with name ‘json\\_extract\\_path\\_text’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”*\n\nSince the simple approach did not work, I attempted a more complex query to achieve the desired result. However, that too did not yield the expected output. To gain better insight, I extracted ten values into a table using the console and then reconstructed the query accordingly. Unfortunately, I am still facing issues related to functions not being recognized in the catalog. I would appreciate any guidance on resolving this issue. I do not need the exact answer; I just want to know if there is any issue with the portal for **Q8**. Thankyou [@lakshaygarg654](/u/lakshaygarg654)\n\nThis might help \n\n# Image Description\n\nThe image features a simple design consisting of a bright yellow circle on a black background.

Their reports depend on accurate historical sales data, but legacy data sources are often messy. RetailWise received an Excel sheet containing 1,000 transaction records generated from scanned receipts. Due to OCR inconsistencies and legacy formatting issues, the data in the Excel sheet is not clean. ## Excel File Structure\n\nThe Excel file has the following columns, and they are messy:\n\n- **Customer Name**: Contains leading/trailing spaces. - **Country**: Uses inconsistent representations. Instead of 2-letter abbreviations, it also contains other values like \"USA\" vs. \"US\", \"U.K\", \"Fra\" for France, \"Bra\" for Brazil, \"Ind\" for India. - **Date**: Uses mixed formats like \"MM-DD-YYYY\", \"YYYY/MM/DD\", etc. - **Product**: Includes a product name followed by a slash and a random code (e.g., \"Theta/5x01vd\"). Only the product name part (before the slash) is relevant. - **Sales and Cost**: Contain extra spaces and the currency string (\"USD\"). In some cases, the Cost field is missing. When it is missing, it should be treated as 50% of the Sales value. - **TransactionID**: Though formatted as four-digit numbers, this field may have inconsistent spacing. ## Your Task\n\nYou need to clean this Excel data and calculate the total margin for all transactions that satisfy the following criteria:\n\n- **Time Filter**: Transactions that occurred up to and including a specified date (Tue Jun 14 2022 04:52:52 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)). - **Product Filter**: Transactions for a specific product (Theta). Use only the product name before the slash. - **Country Filter**: Transactions from a specific country (US), after standardizing the country names. The total margin is defined as:\n\n```\nTotal Margin = (Total Sales - Total Cost) / Total Sales\n```\n\n## Solution Challenges\n\nYour solution should address the following challenges:\n\n1. **Trim and Normalize Strings**: Remove extra spaces from the Customer Name and Country fields. Map inconsistent country names (e.g., \"USA\", \"US\") to a standardized format. 2. **Standardize Date Formats**: Detect and convert dates from \"MM-DD-YYYY\" and \"YYYY/MM/DD\" into a consistent date format (e.g., ISO 8601). 3. **Extract the Product Name**: From the Product field, extract the portion before the slash (e.g., extract \"Theta\" from \"Theta/5x01vd\"). 4. **Clean and Convert Sales and Cost**: Remove the \"USD\" text and extra spaces from the Sales and Cost fields. Convert these fields to numerical values. Handle missing Cost appropriately (50% of Sales). 5. **Filter the Data**: Include only transactions up to and including Tue Jun 14 2022 04:52:52 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time), matching product Theta and country US. 6. **Calculate the Margin**: Sum the Sales and Cost for the filtered transactions. Compute the overall margin using the formula provided. ## Additional Information\n\nBy cleaning the data and calculating accurate margins, RetailWise Inc. can:\n\n- **Improve Decision Making**: Provide clients with reliable analyses to optimize pricing and inventory. - **Enhance Reporting**: Ensure historical data is consistent and accurate, boosting stakeholder confidence. - **Streamline Operations**: Reduce the manual effort needed to clean data from legacy sources. ### Error Message\n\nWhat is the total margin for transactions before Tue Jun 14 2022 04:52:52 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time) for Theta sold in US (which may be spelt in different ways)? Error: Incorrect answer\n\n**Total Margin**: `0.00`\n```\n\n  \nIn this question, I am asked to find the total margin for transactions before **Tue, Jun 14, 2022, 04:52:52 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)** for **Theta** sold in **the US** (which may be spelled in different ways). However, when I filter in Excel for **US** and **Theta**, there are no entries for **Sales** and **Cost**. But **0** as the answer is not accepted—it says the answer is incorrect. (I cross-checked this using GPT.) [@23f2004313](/u/23f2004313)\n\nUS is also called\n\nUnited States  \nUnited States of America  \nUSA\n\nThese are all valid references to US\n\nKind regards I have replaced all the different names of US (all ) as “US” . also sorted the dates as asked in the question . I have checked your GA and I do get sales entries for the criteria in your GA. Please remember that this module is about data cleaning. And that data needs to be sanitised before you start filtering. Kind regards [@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir , I have tried reconstructing the image in ques 10 multiple times and even still the output shows error: image pixels do not match…how can I fix this? # Image Description\n\nThis image depicts a futuristic, neon-lit cityscape. - **Skyline**: Tall, sleek skyscrapers dominate the horizon, featuring a mix of architectural styles with sharp angles and rounded elements. - **Lighting**: The city is illuminated with vibrant hues of blue, pink, and purple, giving it a dynamic and lively atmosphere. - **Transport**: Several futuristic flying vehicles are seen traversing the sky, contributing to the advanced technological theme. - **Roads**: Elevated highways crisscross the city, with glowing lanes that enhance the sense of movement and activity. - **Background**: The scene is set against a twilight sky, transitioning from sunset to night, adding a dramatic backdrop to the illuminated buildings. Overall, the image conveys a sense of advanced technology and urban life in a visually captivating environment. Edit: I got it correct i am also facing the same problem and i have cross verified the pixels but it is still showing the same Now my answer is same and correct i think problem was in TDS matching question like it was matched to other number now programmer correct it and matched to correct value like 4764 # Image Description\n\nThe image is a collage featuring a combination of graphic illustrations and textual elements. It includes the following components:\n\n- **Portraits**: Multiple stylized illustrations of faces, showing various individuals with diverse features and hairstyles. - **Text Elements**: Sections of text that appear to describe personal details, educational backgrounds, work experiences, and other relevant information. Some text includes headings like \"BACKGROUND PROFILE\", \"ACUITE\", and \"ADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE\". - **Decorative Elements**: The background is filled with circuit-like designs and mechanical gears, suggesting a theme of technology or innovation. - **Color Palette**: The overall color scheme is a mix of browns, creams, and muted tones, giving it a vintage mechanical look. The design is reminiscent of a modern infographic, possibly aimed at showcasing profiles or resumes in a creative format. this is my image i coded corrrect mapped to correct pixel but it was saying pixel do not match what is meaning of it sorry i found correct answer i was thinking differently can someone share the answer for the 9th question as i am facing some errors Create your gemini api, convert the video into MP4 and then write the Collab code for the question or ask gpt to write it for you…finally run it on google collab Hi [@Algsoch](/u/algsoch) [@24f2003130](/u/24f2003130)\n\nWhile saving image you might need to pass lossless = True as argument. `img.save(\"filename\", lossless=True)`\n\nkind regards u can use openai whisper free and use yt-dlp package to extract the video and using whisper convert it For Q8, I wrote the following query,\n\n```\nSELECT smo.post_id\nFROM social_media as smo\nWHERE smo.timestamp >= '2024-11-15T06:02:28.656Z'\nAND EXISTS (\n   SELECT 1\n   FROM LATERAL (\n       SELECT UNNEST(json_extract(comments, '$[*]'))\n       FROM social_media as sm\n       WHERE sm.post_id = smo.post_id\n       ) AS c(value)\n    WHERE json_extract(c.value, '$.stars.useful')::DOUBLE = 4)\norder by smo.post_id;\n\n```\n\nWhat it does is for each post\\_id, checks the timestamp and then checks the presence of a json object in comments that has 4 stars useful rating for this post\\_id. Finally returns all the post\\_id’s in ascending order. But it’s giving me an `Array length mismatch` error. I’m stuck here. Any hints would be helpful.

After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds. Here was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed. In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.”\n\nThe mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice. Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind. From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations. Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \" Can anyone provide solution of question 5 related to duckdb module  \nplease is there anyway to practice the assignments and check answers even though the deadline for the assignment passes? or is the answer given somewhere just for learning sake.
