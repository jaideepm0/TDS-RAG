Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton),  \nMy Project 1 scores are not visible on the part, I have definitely submitted before the deadline and on the grades section - its coming as not submitted. I have mailed support team as well. Will it be possible to check the same in any manner. Regards,  \nAjit No one has received their Project 1 scores yet. We are hoping to very soon announce preliminary results. (maybe in 24 hours or so). Depends how many bugs we get bitten by. Kind regards [@carlton](/u/carlton) any updates on the Project 1 results? We are releasing them today. You will get an email with lots of goodies in it \n\nKind regards carlton:\n\n> lots of goodies in it \n\nIt is more frightening now… If we failed in project1 then we will be awarded free marks in Project2 Please conform that [@carlton](/u/carlton) at least give us some awards for our hard work (Summer special offer), what do you say? I think something heavy is coming… But it’s 9:30, and nothing’s here yet. Taking their time, I see! We have marks but we are sending you a package of items as well, for your benefit. We have been waiting for you for a month… and our patience is wearing thin  \n\n# Image Description\n\nThe image features a man sitting on the hood of a vehicle, exuding a confident and stylish demeanor. He has a well-groomed beard and mustache, wearing dark sunglasses and a black suit. His shirt is unbuttoned at the top, revealing some skin. He is holding a cigarette in his right hand and has a relaxed pose, with his left arm resting on his knee. The background is slightly foggy or overexposed, adding a dramatic effect to the scene. The vehicle appears to be a dark SUV. The overall mood conveys a sense of coolness and attitude. you are dealing with the wrong wrong person sir its not showing anything for me, ive got no mail, what should i do? ```markdown\n# Image Description\n\nThe image contains a table with the following columns: **email**, **url**, **result**, **type**, and **message**. ## Table Data\n\n| Index | Email                     | URL                                           | Result | Type        | Message                          |\n|-------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------|-------------|----------------------------------|\n| 1     | 22f3000118@ds.study.iitm.ac.in | dog/diya                                   | FAIL   | Docker      | No public DockerHub image        |\n| 2     | 22f3000118@ds.study.iitm.ac.in | https://github.com/22f3000118/Project-1   | OK     | Repo        | exists                           |\n| 3     | 22f3000118@ds.study.iitm.ac.in | https://github.com/22f3000118/Project-1   | OK     | License     | LICENSE                          |\n| 4     | 22f3000118@ds.study.iitm.ac.in | https://github.com/22f3000118/Project-1   | FAIL   | Dockerfile  | No Dockerfile                    |\n| 5     | 22f3000118@ds.study.iitm.ac.in | https://github.com/22f3000118/Project-1   | OK     | Clone       | Cloned                           |\n```\n\nYou failed pre requisites check. Hence there is no evaluation email. i.e. the score is 0 which will be pushed to dashboard on after 1/4/25\n\nOnly those that passed the pre requisite check got emails with scores. Sir can you check and say if I passed or not. The link that I submitted for project 1 in the gform contains two links. I wrote ‘and’ between two website link. My mail id: 23f3000975@ds.study.iitm.ac.in Sir, I hope you’re doing well. I haven’t received any email regarding **Project 1** results. Could you please confirm if there’s an issue? my mail id: 23f2000798@ds.study.iitm.ac.in No issue with your submission, you will get a good score. Kind regards Hi you were supposed to provide just one github link in the format specified. You failed to do that and therefore your submission was not evaluated.
