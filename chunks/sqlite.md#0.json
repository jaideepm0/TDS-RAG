  "content": "## Database: SQLite\n\nRelational databases are used to store data in a structured way. You'll often access databases created by others for analysis. PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL, Oracle, etc. are popular databases. But the most installed database is [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html). It's embedded into many devices and apps (e.g. your phone, browser, etc.). It's lightweight but very scalable and powerful. Watch these introductory videos to understand SQLite and how it's used in Python (34 min):\n\n[! [SQLite Introduction - Beginners Guide to SQL and Databases (22 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/8Xyn8R9eKB8/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/8Xyn8R9eKB8)\n\n[! [SQLite Backend for Beginners - Create Quick Databases with Python and SQL (13 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Ohj-CqALrwk/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/Ohj-CqALrwk)\n\nThere are many non-relational databases (NoSQL) like [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/), [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/latest/), etc. that you should know about and we may cover later. Core Concepts:\n\n```sql\n-- Create a table\nCREATE TABLE users (\n    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n    name TEXT NOT NULL,\n    email TEXT UNIQUE,\n    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n\n-- Insert data\nINSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES\n    ('Alice', 'alice@example.com'),\n    ('Bob', 'bob@example.com');\n\n-- Query data\nSELECT name, COUNT(*) as count\nFROM users\nGROUP BY name\nHAVING count > 1;\n\n-- Join tables\nSELECT u.name, o.product\nFROM users u\nLEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id\nWHERE o.status = 'pending';\n```\n\nPython Integration:\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport pandas as pd\n\nasync def query_database(db_path: Path, query: str) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    \"\"\"Execute SQL query and return results as DataFrame. Args:\n        db_path: Path to SQLite database\n        query: SQL query to execute\n\n    Returns:\n        DataFrame with query results\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)\n        return pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)\n    finally:\n        conn.close()\n\n# Example usage\ndb = Path('data.db')\ndf = await query_database(db, '''\n    SELECT date, COUNT(*) as count\n    FROM events\n    GROUP BY date\n''')\n```\n\nCommon Operations:\n\n1. **Database Management**\n\n   ```sql\n   -- Backup database\n   .backup 'backup.db'\n\n   -- Import CSV\n   .mode csv\n   .import data.csv table_name\n\n   -- Export results\n   .headers on\n   .mode csv\n   .output results.csv\n   SELECT * FROM table;\n   ```\n\n2. **Performance Optimization**\n\n   ```sql\n   -- Create index\n   CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON users(email);\n\n   -- Analyze query\n   EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN\n   SELECT * FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%@example.com';\n\n   -- Show indexes\n   SELECT * FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='index';\n   ```\n\n3. **Data Analysis**\n\n   ```sql\n   -- Time series aggregation\n   SELECT\n       date(timestamp),\n       COUNT(*) as events,\n       AVG(duration) as avg_duration\n   FROM events\n   GROUP BY date(timestamp);\n\n   -- Window functions\n   SELECT *,\n       AVG(amount) OVER (\n           PARTITION BY user_id\n           ORDER BY date\n           ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW\n       ) as moving_avg\n   FROM transactions;\n   ```\n\nTools to work with SQLite:\n\n- [SQLiteStudio](https://sqlitestudio.pl/): Lightweight GUI\n- [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/): Full-featured GUI\n- [sqlite-utils](https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/): CLI tool\n- [Datasette](https://datasette.io/): Web interface"
