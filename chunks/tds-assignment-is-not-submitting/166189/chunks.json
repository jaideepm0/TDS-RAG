[GA2 - Deployment Tools - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga2-deployment-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161120/171) [Tools in Data Science](/c/courses/tds-kb/34)\n\n> We have removed that button, cause it was causing confusion among the students. > If you have saved your answers on the TDS portal then you need not worry, you will be marked. The button was just there to ensure you saw the assignment on the TDS portal. > Regards,\n> TDS TA\n\nRead this I saved that too but right now scores of GA2 isn’t visible for me. And in score section it’s showing assignment not submitted. [@Saransh\\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) Your scores are evaluated on a site that is external to the seek portal and is not integrated with the seek portal. Therefore seek does not know if you have submitted or not and by default says that it has not been submitted because it cannot see your external evaluation. There will not be a fix for this for some time. Scores for GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5, Project1, Project2, ROE will NOT be inside your seek portal. **The scores will only be visible in the dashboard. ** Just ignore anything inside seek portal. The dashboard is where all your subject score cards exists. As stated in multiple places on discourse as well as in live sessions, The final score is always your last submission. If your dashboard score does not match your final submission score on the assignment page, only then contact us regarding your marks.

Key elements include:\n\n- **Header**: Displays the title \"exam.sandbox.wordendays.nd-2025-03-93\" with the note \"Ended at Wed, 5 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST\". - **Warning Message**: A red message alerts users that the browser may face loading issues and suggests using different browsers or turning off security restrictions. - **Login Notification**: A message indicates the user is logged in as \"a2f300460686@student.iiitm.ac.in\". - **Logout Option**: A \"Logout\" button is visible. - **Recent Saves**: A section labeled \"Recent saves\" lists three attempts with timestamps (2/1/2025 at 4:04:11 PM, 4:06:37 PM, and 4:06:28 PM) and scores (all showing a score of 8). - **Questions Section**: Labeled \"Questions\", but specific details about the questions are not visible. The interface has a clean layout with a focus on exam-related functionality and user interactions.\") Dear Bhavanagv,\n\nThe scores have not been pushed to the dashboard yet. Ignore seek portal. Seek portal will not have your submission or your scores because it is evaluated externally from the seek portal. Kind regards I had submitted the assignment still it’s shwoing that my score is 0 and that i have not submitted the assignment. Can you please look into it as i had saved my answers as well timely. ```markdown\n## Recent Saves\n\n- **[Reload]** from **2/2/2025, 9:04:58 PM. ** Score: **4**\n- **[Reload]** from **2/2/2025, 9:04:53 PM. ** Score: **4**\n- **[Reload]** from **2/2/2025, 9:04:51 PM. ** Score: **4**\n\nNote: There is a red dot indicator next to the first entry. ``` same thing with my assignment even though i submitted it Scores will soon be pushed to seek portal, till then it will show 0. Same for me…deadline is over and assignment not submitted… same issue here as well Yes, same observation for my assignment as well. Scores for GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5, Project1, Project2, ROE will NOT be inside your seek portal. The scores will only be visible in the dashboard. Just ignore anything inside the seek portal. As stated in multiple places in discourse as well as in live sessions, The final score is always your last submission. Kind regards There are some errors in grading for GA2 and GA3 for TDS, even after submitting the assignments score 0 was given and the seek portal displayed assignment was not submitted given that the login was from my own account and was submitted before the time and still got a score of 0. ```markdown\n# Exam Instructions and Information\n\n- **Ending Time:** Wednesday, 5 February 2025, 11:59 PM IST\n\n## Instructions:\n\n1. **Learn what you need. ** Reading material is provided, but feel free to skip it if you can answer the question (or learn it just for pleasure). 2. **Check answers regularly** by pressing the check button, which shows which answers are right or wrong.
