This is the final Mock before actual ROE. [drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qg_KPFup6Tu49RP5qGRVnU13j1QKiilq/edit)\n\n### [mock\\_roe\\_4.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qg_KPFup6Tu49RP5qGRVnU13j1QKiilq/edit)\n\nGoogle Drive file. We have a **special** session scheduled for tonight from 8pm to 10pm. We will be sharing some important information during that session which will help you for your ROE. It is available in your google calendar. The meet link for that session is:\n\nROE Preparation - TDS\n\nFriday, February 28 · 8:00 – 10:00pm\n\nTime zone: Asia/Kolkata\n\nVideo call link: <https://meet.google.com/nnq-sxqh-ryw>\n\nThe session will be recorded and live streamed on YouTube. It will be available on the TDS YouTube Playlist later. Kind regards, \nTDS Team\n-----------------------\n\n### Update 4\n\n#### 27/02/2025 7:18pm\n\nDear Learner,\n\nPlease find the link to Mock ROE 3 below. Note the datasets links are present inside the given document (there are more than 1):\n\n[drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kQKiBccRn6sUV_dvjk3ROZQKrc50oHfq/edit)\n\n### [MOCK ROE 3.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kQKiBccRn6sUV_dvjk3ROZQKrc50oHfq/edit)\n\nGoogle Drive file. The estimated time for this Mock ROE 3 is 45 mins. All the best, \nTDS Team\n-----------------------\n\n### Update 3\n\n#### 26/02/2025 8:11 pm\n\nDear Learner\n\nPlease access the Mock ROE 2 at this link:\n\n\n[exam.sanand.workers.dev](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2024-sep-roe1)\n\n### [Technical Assessment](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2024-sep-roe1)\n\nThere is no time limit for this Mock. The expected time to solve this ROE is 45 mins. Set an alarm and try it. After the session at 9pm there will be a session where we will show you the solutions step by step (not like the previous session which was a demo of ROE). To check your answers you will need to run the following script in the console. ```\ninputs = document.querySelectorAll('input')\ntextboxes = document.querySelectorAll(\"textarea\")\nbuttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button\")\ninputs.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));\nbuttons.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));\ntextboxes.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));\n\n```\n\nDo not submit or save your answers. All the best! Kind regards  \nTDS Team\n\n### Update 2\n\n#### 26/02/2025 11:00 am\n\nWe will be releasing Mock 2 tonight on an exam portal at 8pm (no time limit). The link for the Mock 2 will be available in this post as well as in the Seek Portal. An email will also be sent with the link to Mock 2. We will be conducting a solving session at 9pm. This will be a regular teaching session (not like the first session on Tuesday 25/02/25 which was a real preview of what ROE looks like). Kind regards,  \nTDS Team\n\n\n### Announcement\n\n#### 25/02/2025\n\nThis same information is available in the seek portal as well. The data for Mock ROE 1 is available at this link:\n\n[Jivraj-18/tds-jan-2025-mock-roe-1](https://github.com/Jivraj-18/tds-jan-2025-mock-roe-1)\n\nThe questions for Mock ROE 1 is available at this link:\n\n<https://forms.gle/UWhvLQvjrJmnvMSn6>\n\nIMPORTANT: We will accept only a single submission of the Mock Question Form. Solve all the questions first, and then fill the form and make a single submission at the end. The form submission will be temporarily closed after 8pm. We have provided this for you to test yourself. The expected time to complete this Mock ROE is 45 mins. We will allow access to the Mock ROE and the question form after the live solving session tonight. All the best! Should we use data mentioned in headline of form or mail data. ? From where can I get today’s live sessions link either is fine. Both have the same data but slightly different presentations From google calendar\n\n!

Its a timed mock. atleast close 5 mins early I would have copied the questions live session gmeet link is not available? After seeing the Mock, I have to say, please give more time for ROE exam, anything less than 1 hour seems extremely difficult. where can we find link for recording of live session which happened after this mock roe ? thanks When will it reopen? dear [@carlton](/u/carlton)  \nwhen will yesterday’s recorded session on mock ROE 1 be uploaded on YouTube? [@23f2003413](/u/23f2003413)\n\nWe will have it uploaded sometime this morning. It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:\n\n1. The chaos of ROE. 2. The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools. 3. The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this). 4. The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team. 5. **The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly**\n6. Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions\n7. The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well). 8. How limited the time is. The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE. Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us. Today’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit). I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock. Kind regards Thank you! will check out the session today Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir , for me given constituency was `\"SRI GOBINDPUR\"`  \nand in the dataset there are multiple names for this constituency i think over the period names were changed of this constituency  \ni have filtered constituencies from punjab using below code in colab\n\n```\ndf_gobindpur = df[df[\"AC\"].str.contains(\"SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR\", case=False, na=False)]\n\n```\n\nis this correct approach or i have to consider only SRI GOBINDPUR name only? but then this constituency is not availble after 1957\n\nusing above filtering i got below data for SRI GOBINDPUR\n\n[drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PHMvoD16Mqino-9SC8uaUtVU3bVuxkD7/view?usp=sharing)\n\n### [df\\_gobindpur.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PHMvoD16Mqino-9SC8uaUtVU3bVuxkD7/view?usp=sharing)\n\nGoogle Drive file. then i used margin formula as\n\n```\nmargin_percentage = ((winner_votes - runner_up_votes) / total_votes) * 100\n\n```\n\nusing this i got answer for 1st question as\n\n```\nYEAR                              1992\nAC                   4 SRIHARGOBINDPUR\nWINNER                  1 GURNAM SINGH\nWINNER_PARTY                       CPI\nWINNER_VOTES                    5000.0\nRUNNER_UP               2 MUSTAK MASIH\nRUNNER_UP_PARTY                    INC\nRUNNER_UP_VOTES                 1115.0\nMARGIN_PERCENTAGE            50.599114\n\n```\n\nwhich is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64  \npls guide where i might be wrong, thanks shubhamatkal:\n\n> ```\n> df_gobindpur = df[df[\"AC\"].str.contains(\"SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR\", case=False, na=False)]\n>\n> ```\n\nFor this kind of name difference you can use Openrefine software\n\n shubhamatkal:\n\n> which is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64\n\nThat answer is wrong, we will be releasing a script with correct python snippets. Kind regards. [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)  \n“SATHUPALLE” and “NILANGA” were two of the four constituencies which were assigned to me. However, even with phonetic match, I couldn’t find any data for these. Closest I could find to SATHUPALLE is “Sattenapalle”, however, two are different locations 150km+ apart as per google maps. Are these really in the dataset? Hi [@23f2005138](/u/23f2005138),\n\nWe didn’t validate locations on Nominathim, so there might be some problems. kind regards The way the instructor extracted the data was not clear in the live session. Please release code or explain properly please. [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton) Hi [@23f1002382](/u/23f1002382)\n\nSolutions for ROE will be released soon. Kind regrads [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) Is the Mock ROE link out, if it is please merge into that, i could not find it. If it is not yet updated, please do and also merge with relevant post please, Cheers Is the link out? … For Feb 26th? 8 pm? no communication regarding ROE-2? <https://22f3001919.github.io/tds_project_1_may_24/> also this link is down? dataset for ROE 1? do we have mock ROE 2 today [@carlton](/u/carlton) ? Kindly confirm the timings! Did you all not solve the ROE already? Q1: Download and unzip q-count-gold-ticket-sales-from-html.zip. It has a set of HTML files, each with tables of 3 columns: Type, Units, and Price. What is the total sales of all the items in the “Gold” ticket type? Round to 2 decimal places (e.g. 123.40). ```\n!unzip /content/q-count-gold-ticket-sales-from-html.zip -d /content/extracted_folder\n\n```\n\n```\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\n\n\n\ntotal_sales = 0\nhtml_folder = \"/content/extracted_folder\"  # Update if the folder name is different\n\nfor file in os.listdir(html_folder):\n    if file.endswith(\".html\"):\n        file_path = os.path.join(html_folder, file)\n\n        # Step 3: Read the HTML content and extract tables\n        with open(file_path, \"r\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as f:\n            soup = BeautifulSoup(f, \"html.parser\")\n        \n        tables = pd.read_html(str(soup))  # Extract all tables\n\n        for table in tables:\n            if {\"Type\", \"Units\", \"Price\"}.issubset(table.columns):\n                # Step 4: Filter \"Gold\" ticket type and calculate total sales\n                table[\"Type\"] = table[\"Type\"].str.strip().str.lower()\n                gold_sales = table[table[\"Type\"] == \"gold\"][\"Units\"] * table[table[\"Type\"] == \"gold\"][\"Price\"]\n                total_sales += gold_sales.sum()\n# Step 5: Print the result rounded to 2 decimal places\nprint(f\"Total Gold Ticket Sales: {total_sales:.2f}\")\n\n\n```\n\n@all Q2: Download and unzip q-least-unique-subjects-from-csv.zip. It has 2 files:\n\n1. `students.csv` has 2 columns:\n2. studentId: A unique identifier for each student\n3. class: The class (including section) of the student\n4. `subjects.csv` has 2 columns:\n5. studentId: The identifier for each student\n6. subject: The name of the subject they have chosen\n\nWhat are the least number of subjects any class has taken up? List the 3 lowest count of subjects in order. ```\n!unzip /content/q-least-unique-subjects-from-csv.zip -d /content/extracted_folder\nimport pandas as pd\ndf1 = pd.read_csv(\"/content/extracted_folder/students.csv\")\ndf2 = pd.read_csv(\"/content/extracted_folder/subjects.csv\")\nmerged_df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on=\"studentId\")\nclass_subject_counts = merged_df.groupby(\"class\")[\"subject\"].nunique()\nlowest_subject_counts = class_subject_counts.nsmallest(3)\nprint(lowest_subject_counts)\n\n```\n\n@all Hi [@23f1002382](/u/23f1002382)  \nThat’s a private repo, so won’t be accessible now. use [Jivraj-18/tds-jan-2025-mock-roe-1](https://github.com/Jivraj-18/tds-jan-2025-mock-roe-1), It have same dataset in some other format. Kind regards [@23f1002382](/u/23f1002382) Good to see students are collaborating for Solving questions, this is exactly what helps a lot in real ROE. @all  \nQ: You are the operations manager for World Courier. You are trying to find the shortest path between `Doha` and `Muscat`. World Courier has a fleet of aircraft that can fly directly between specific cities. The distance between two cities is the [Haversine distance](https://pypi.org/project/haversine/). What is the sequence of cities that you should fly to minimize the total distance traveled? Write the answer as a sequence of cities separated by commas."

Sir, Can we get these live sessions recorded on YouTube We are expecting you to collaborate. But you got to do it in a methodical organised way. Like NASA trying to get the 3 men in Apollo 13 back home. Work together like a team. One man band is tough or impossible. So is a hodgepodge of directionless people. So a proper team can perhaps crack it. Kind regards But there is seems to be a very thin line between collaborating and people just taking other people’s code and using them to generate their answer instead of also participating in the collaboration. So I was confused about the “collaborating” thing. I understand that sentiment. I struggle with it a lot too when discussing it with Anand. Is there value or learning, in blind copying. Im not so sure. At some point someone has to learn to become an expert. A critical thinker. There is even a Microsoft study now that shows that GPT usage impacts critical thinking. Are we going to end up with a generation of people who can no longer critically think to solve a problem? These are good philosophical questions. I lie somewhere more on the conservative side of that spectrum. But everyone has to grapple with this tradeoff. Where does the right balance lie? I don’t know the answer to that question for others. I know the right answer for me. Kind regards Thanks, today’s mock was manageable unlike yesterday’s one. I got some correct within 45 minutes, but yesterday, I couldn’t even complete scraping. I feel less complex (but still questions that test your critical thinking) and proctored ROE (with access to documentation of the different services used) could help. In this way people can use gpt models to crack the difficult GA questions but through ROE you can actually still test their knowledge on the topics which are covered. But this too has its caveats, there doesn’t seem to be a proper solution to this There was no need to scrape Sagan, you could have copied the whole table and pasted it into an excel sheet and exported it as a csv file. Try it out once! sir only 26feb one is available but session of roe on 25feb is not available can u please upload it and yeah even live session schedule for this is also not showing . wanted to know the format ,if its like a oppe or just a graded assignment with time limit . Will be uploaded sometime by tomorrow. Live schedule is on the calendar, sometimes google calendar can be glitchy. you might have to check your settings and make sure you have subscribed to the right calendar What all weeks are included in ROE? ? Modules 1 to 5 is the syllabus for ROE. We will do a final run down of the topics on a special (highly recommended) friday session (will be scheduled shortly). Kind regards Mock ROE-1 & Mock ROE-2 sessions have not yet been uploaded in YouTube yet [@carlton](/u/carlton) . Can you please upload both these videos at the earliest so that we could prepare from those videos. Many of us have no idea about how to solve these questions within the given timeframe, so it is highly appreciable that the team uploads these recorded live sessions in YT at the earliest. Thanks! The recordings of these sessions are already available. [Mock 1](https://drive.google.com/file/u/1/d/1FTpoBrflLUJicycg3uu2R2dF2KZ9dRsM/view?usp=drive_web)  \n[Mock 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19LRqnJ7Gl0X4pK5xc17eCQA-79hbTZKE/view)\n\nThey are all available in the calendar  \n\n```markdown\n# Live Session - TDS\n\n**Date:**  \nTuesday, 25 February  \n**Time:**  \n8:00 PM - 10:00 PM  \n**Frequency:**  \nWeekly on Tuesday until 8 April 2025\n\n## Join Options\n\n- [Join with Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/odh-ycbm-ahj)\n\n### Join by Phone\n- (US) +1 904-580-8620 PIN: 749 760 268#\n\n### Additional Information\n- More phone numbers may be available. - The full guest list has been hidden at the organiser's request. ### YouTube Playlist\n- [View Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_h5u1jMeBC1BquBhgunA4t08XAsxA-C) do we have the Mock-ROE today? [@carlton](/u/carlton)  \n\n```markdown\n# Patent Questions:\n\n## Q1\nGiven a dataset: Which patent(s) have the highest number of claims? Cite the patent ID. If you have multiple patents with the same number of claims, list them all separated by commas without spaces. The parameter file without the extension is assumed as the Patent ID. E.g., for the below data, Patent ID is `US20230222520A1-20230720`. Start coding or generate with AI. [@23f2004837](/u/23f2004837)\n\nYes its available in the first post of this page, as well in email and online seek portal. [@trebhuvansb](/u/trebhuvansb)\n\nThere is only 1 patent question. Intentional, its hard enough to do all questions [@carlton](/u/carlton)  \nHow many questions will we be having in our ROE? Because I remember Anand sir mentioning 17 questions in the explanation of the difficulty of the ROE It completely depends on the ROE. There is just no reasonable way of knowing how many questions ROE will have. If there is only 1 question, I would be very worried. Kind regards Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir, I have not got any mail for the ROE exam yet. Can you please check this out and conform me. And also tell us, how will we access the exam. I thought the mocks would be a representation of the actual ROE and the mocks had 6 questions so I assumed 6 questions. Mocks are just to give you a feel of what an ROE is about, and to get you comfortable with the 45 min time limit. So, the number of questions in the real ROE is going to have little correlation with the question count in the mocks. Respected [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) , [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) , [@carlton](/u/carlton)\n\nBased on the ROE mock assessments, I kindly request you to consider extending the allotted time for the ROE. Some tasks require downloading libraries, whereas you may already have these libraries or other necessary setups in place, which naturally reduces your solving time. As you are aware, additional time will only benefit those who have prepared and possess the required knowledge. Students without preparation will not gain any advantage simply due to an extension. Furthermore, as the course has been modified from the previous term and many aspects are still being refined, we have already requested measures to support our performance and ensure our grades are not put at undue risk. I genuinely prioritize knowledge over marks and have put in significant effort to excel in this course. However, I do not want to risk failing. My goal is simply to meet the passing criteria (at least 40 marks) . Therefore, I sincerely request you to consider granting additional time for the ROE as a reasonable relief. Your understanding and support in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Best Regards,  \nLakshay Yes sir it will be helpful for us Yes [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir, please look into it and we request you to extend the allotted time. “If there is only 1 question, I would be very worried”   \n\nFound this to be funny! Yeah especially if the system is slow, it takes too much time to download libraries. Colab provides more RAM but it frequently stops runtime and restarting it again is very time-consuming. Can we team up with you in roe ? ? ? [@carlton](/u/carlton) Can you please share the pdf that you were showing in today’s meeting Hi [@23f1001231](/u/23f1001231) link is now available in the first post of this thread. ```markdown\n# Image Description\n\nThe image displays a text-based user interface, likely from a programming or cybersecurity exercise. It features a dark-themed editor that includes the following elements:\n\n1. **Header**: \n   - The header states \"SecurePrompt Technologies\" and provides a brief overview of the company's focus on cybersecurity and large language models (LLMs) for enterprise applications. 2. **Content Section**:\n   - The text discusses security measures and testing protocols used by SecurePrompt to ensure LLMs adhere to strict security policies. - A task is presented, simulating an attack vector where the user must manipulate the LLM to make it say \"Yes\", despite being instructed never to do so. - It emphasizes the importance of understanding vulnerabilities within instruction adherence for improving model security. 3. **Instructions**:\n   - The user is instructed to use an \"AI Proxy\" token to interact with the LLM and write a prompt that would elicit a \"Yes\" response. - A cautionary note advises users to be mindful with their prompts, clarifying that successful attempts can yield different results in subsequent tries. 4. **Input Field**:\n   - At the bottom, there is an input field where users are expected to type their prompt. Overall, the image reflects a technical context focused on cybersecurity practices in relation to AI and LLM interactions. ```\n\n[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) This is a question of GA 3. I tried AI hallucination, but was unsuccessful. Can you please tell what will be the appropriate prompt? Hi [@23f1001231](/u/23f1001231)  \nHere is a blog post made by Anand Sir [Hacking an obnoxious, unhelpful LLM to say Yes - S Anand](https://www.s-anand.net/blog/hacking-an-obnoxious-unhelpful-llm-to-say-yes/)  \nGive it a read, it would be helpful. What is the highest average inspection score in the month 2015-05 that any latitude-  \nlongitude grid (rounded off to 2 decimal places) has received? not receiving right answer any body tried mock 4  \nfor tds roe exam Hi,\n\nI have started attempting the MOCKs, But I don’t know how to scrap the data from the link which is provided for MOCK 1. I couldn’t find this in recorded sessions as well. Anyone please suggest a way to do it. agreed, the time is very less  \nwe can solve all questions if time is increased, even a little ```\nfrom shapely.geometry import Polygon, Point\nimport json\n\nwith open(\"regions.json\", \"r\") as f:\n    data = json.load(f)\n\npickup_locations = [\n    (6.488, -78.0287),\n    (32.0198, -99.7243),\n    (16.7257, -58.7811),\n    (1.9307, 45.4928),\n    (-34.6289, 133.0359)\n]\n\ncities = data[\"cities\"]\nregions = data[\"regions\"]\n\nmatching_regions = []\n\nfor request_point in pickup_locations:\n    point = Point(request_point)\n    region_num = 1\n\n    for region in regions:\n        region_coordinates = [(cities[city][0], cities[city][1]) for city in region]\n        region_polygon = Polygon(region_coordinates)\n\n        if region_polygon.contains(point):\n            matching_regions.append(str(region_num))\n            break  # Stop checking once a match is found\n        region_num += 1\n\nprint(\",\".join(matching_regions))\n\n```\n\nI have been trying this for the past 1 day and i still cant get the answer for mock roe 2, q5  \n2 of my coordinates r not giving any value  \ncan someone please help\n\n[@carlton](/u/carlton) The json from the webpage does not match the data in the mock roe webpage. Its a little trick that Anand implemented so that its not so easy to do. It was basically to see if you could spot the difference. These things do happen in the real world where the backend sends something and someone has done some जुगाड़ code on the front end just to get the job done for the client. So when you are trying to scrape the data for some analysis things dont quite seem what they are."
