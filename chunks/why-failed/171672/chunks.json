Your GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible\n2. Your GitHub repository has a LICENSE file with the MIT license\n3. Your GitHub repository has a valid Dockerfile\n4. Your Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`\n5. Your Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in your GitHub repository\n\nIf you fail to meet this minimum requirement your submission will not get evaluated. ## Project 1 Prerequisite Evaluations:\n- **Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public:** PASS\n- **Is Github repo present AND public:** PASS\n- **Is `Dockerfile` present in root of github repo:** PASS\n- **Is MIT license present at root of github repo:** FAIL\n\n## Summary:\n- **Prerequisites:** FAIL\n- **Project 1 Score:** 0\n```\n\n  \n[virajpitale/tds-project1](https://github.com/virajpitale/tds-project1)  \non github you can clearly see i added mit license still it is showing failed # Image Description\n\nThe image is a screenshot from GitHub Docs, specifically from the section on adding a license to a repository. ## Key Elements:\n\n- **Header**: The top displays \"GitHub Docs\" along with a version indicator (\"Free, Pro, & Team\") and a breadcrumb navigation leading to the article title: \"Add a license to a repo.\" - **Instructions**:\n  - **Step 3**: Instructs users to type `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md` in the file name field, highlighted in bold. - **Step 4**: Contains a visual of a file name input field labeled with \"octo-repo / LICENSE\" and a button labeled \"Choose a license template.\" - **Additional Information**: \n  - On the left, it prompts users to review available licenses and select one. - Step 6 encourages users to click \"Review and submit.\" The overall layout showcases a clear, step-by-step guide for users on how to add a license to their project on GitHub. I checked your github repo MIT License file is named as `Licenese.md` but standard naming for License is LICENSE or LICENSE.md (with all caps). So, should I edit the filename now, or will you count it as missing? [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) please reply # Commit History\n\n## Commits on April 3, 2025\n- **Message:** Rename `License.md` to `LICENSE.md`\n  - **Author:** viapipeline (subscribed 4 days ago)\n  - **Status:** Verified\n  - **Commit ID:** `d6302ee`\n  \n## Commits on February 17, 2025\n- **Message:** Update `License.md`\n  - **Author:** viapipeline (authored on Feb 17)\n  - **Status:** Verified\n  - **Commit ID:** `7642080`\n\n## Commits on February 15, 2025\n- **Message:** Update and rename `README.md` to `License.md`\n  - **Author:** viapipeline (authored on Feb 15)\n  - **Status:** Verified\n  - **Commit ID:** `267575a`\n\n- **Message:** `project`\n  - **Author:** viapipeline (committed on Feb 15)\n  - **Status:** Verified\n  - **Commit ID:** `d43ac6`\n\n  \nI submitted the project **within the deadline**, and I ensured that **all requirements were fulfilled**, including correctly adding the MIT License file. The license file was named properly and contained the correct content. However, I received a message stating that the MIT License was not present, and that the prerequisites were not completed — resulting in a failed status. This is surprising and feels unfair, as I’ve double-checked my submission and confirmed that everything, including the license file, is in place and named correctly. Here is my GitHub repo for your reference: [GitHub - virajpitale/tds-project1](https://github.com/virajpitale/tds-project1)\n\nI kindly request a re-evaluation of my submission, as I believe I’ve met all the required criteria. I would really appreciate your time in looking into this matter again. Thank you for your understanding. [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)"
