So just wait till it gets pushed by operations (most likely Tuesday). I can assure you that we have the right scores on our server, there is just an issue when “transporting” those scores over to the operations team, which we have now rectified and since scores are batch processed it will happen over night during a server update. Bottom line: wait till Tuesday  \nBoth bonus and your actual roe scores will reflect on dashboard by then. If not let us know\n\nKind regards.
