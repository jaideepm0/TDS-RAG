[Cleaning data with OpenRefine](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/zxEtfHseE84/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/zxEtfHseE84)\n\nThis session covers the use of OpenRefine for data cleaning, focusing on resolving entity discrepancies:\n\n- **Data Upload and Project Creation**: Import data into OpenRefine and create a new project for analysis. - **Faceting Data**: Use text facets to group similar entries and identify frequency of address crumbs. - **Clustering Methodology**: Apply clustering algorithms to merge similar entries with minor differences, such as punctuation. - **Manual and Automated Clustering**: Learn to merge clusters manually or in one go, trusting the system's clustering accuracy. - **Entity Resolution**: Clean and save the data by resolving multiple versions of the same entity using Open Refine.
