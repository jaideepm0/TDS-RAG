    "content": "This is the official page for discussing anything related to the ROE itself. Please limit posts on this thread to technical questions or doubts regarding the ROE itself. The Remote Online Exam has been scheduled for\n\nSunday, 2nd March 2025 (**02/03/2025** ) at **1:00pm**\n\nThe exam link will become available at the below mentioned site, 1 hour before the start time:\n\n[https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/exam.html](http://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/exam.html)\n\n[EDIT]\n\n* There will be a [Gmeet manned by the course team](https://meet.google.com/bah-uytq-osu) from Sunday, March 2, 2025 7:20 AM→Sunday, March 2, 2025 8:20 AM to solve your technical issues (timeouts, question not visible etc). * Please do not ask concept related questions in this meet. Use this only for clarifying technical issues. **If your issue is resolved, PLEASE EXIT THE MEET. ** Lurkers will be penalized \n* There is a bonus provided for [student feedback](https://forms.gle/TXxz1yr5fpcz5bh89) on the ROE exam preparation and attempt. This will be available till Sunday, March 2, 2025 11:30 AM\n\nAll the best,  \nTDS Team Would we be able to start work on the questions 1 hour before the exam start time? [@bhashwar\\_sengupta](/u/bhashwar_sengupta) No that will not be possible. It will go live only at 1 pm. Got it. Thank you. Also, are there any standard set of instructions that we need to follow during the ROE, like in OPPEs? Is it 45 minutes long? No, it is 45 minutes ‘short’ [@carlton](/u/carlton) will exam take place on the IITM Exam Portal (like other JAVA, Python OPPE) or will it take place on the TDS course portal like we had for Weekly GA? Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir, I could only find one live session of ROE in youtube. Can you please point out where are the other recordings? All week 7 sessions are ROE mock solving questions. Only the 4th session was a special session and was labelled as such, but it also has a mock solving component. These are all available on the Youtube channel Sir we have to join the google meet for ROE or it’s an open book exam? Is there a google meet that we have to join for proctoring? [@carlton](/u/carlton)\n\nI hope the Remote Online Exam (ROE) is ready to be uploaded to the portal. Is there any update regarding the additional time request? Can we expect any consideration on this? I submitted my request at the following link:  \n[Request for additional time for roe](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/mock-roe-1-2-3-4-tds-jan-2025/168449/66) [@carlton](/u/carlton) Is the exam link enabled yet?

Getting my pet ready to ace the roe. sir help i tried in incognito as well The exam link is working now. were you able to resolve it ? Yup! Based on previous GAs, 45 minutes seems pretty short. HOW WILL WE BE ABLE TO ACCESS ANSWERS, WHETHER THEY ARE CORRECT OR INCORRECT. JUST LIKE IN GAs?? will we have a “check” button? ? Its fine the link is correct. Just that the exam is not available at the moment, we have changed the error message. Exam will start at 1pm. Its also hackable to start before. You will have a check button We have updated the error message. yes … us ai, phone a friend, also ping here… ping here? does that mean we are allowed to discuss here? No this thread is only for technical doubts faced by students. But, you can create another thread to discuss it. Thats much encouraged. [@24f2007378](/u/24f2007378) thank you, got one extra answer because of this. Thank you Teachers for a great preparation using mock it helped us a lot and really very difficult but interesting exam. Thanks all for ROE exam. Got 9/10 , mostly guessing many might have got full as prev. mocks conducted in last week was used. But, I want to thank for mock sessions , appreciate all you TA’s efforts in last week. Take care\n\nRegards,  \nHarsha I tried many times for correlation question. using numoy, excel, writing explicit function. for all the three, i got -0.7144 as the answer. but the portal showed incorrret. Challenging ROE. Definitely should’ve studied more # Image Description\n\nThe image showcases a dual-screen setup displaying two different applications. ## Left Side:\n- **Application**: A web-based coding platform or exam interface. - **Content**:\n  - A task description is visible, instructing to write a FastAPI proxy server that serves data from a given URL while also adding a CORS header (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`) to the responses. - There is a countdown timer at the top indicating 26 minutes and 36 seconds remaining. - A red error message states: \"Error: Incorrect response\" with a prompt for the user to input their FastAPI proxy URL endpoint. ## Right Side:\n- **Application**: An API testing tool (possibly Postman). - **Content**:\n  - A GET request is being configured with a specified URL (`http://127.0.0.1:8000`). - Below it, there are sections for query parameters and response details. - A status line indicates a \"200 OK\" response with size and time taken for the request. - The output shows a portion of the API response, including HTML and JSON elements. ### Additional Elements:\n- The status bar at the bottom indicates various activities and logs from the API tool. - The interface includes settings for sending requests, checking responses, and managing collections.\") [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh\\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) Sir, can you please tell me why this was not accepted? here is my code:\n\n```\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException\nfrom fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware\nimport httpx\nimport uvicorn\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n# Add CORS middleware to handle preflight OPTIONS requests\napp.add_middleware(\n    CORSMiddleware,\n    allow_origins=[\"*\"],\n    allow_credentials=True,\n    allow_methods=[\"*\"],\n    allow_headers=[\"*\"],\n)\n\n@app.get(\"/api\")\nasync def proxy(url: str, request: Request):\n    headers = {key: value for key, value in request.headers.items() if key.lower() != \"host\"}\n    try:\n        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:\n            response = await client.get(url, headers=headers)\n            return response.text\n    except httpx.RequestError as e:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f\"Request failed: {str(e)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    uvicorn.run(app, host=\"127.0.0.1\", port=8000)\n\n```\n\nhere are the responses:\n\n```\nINFO:     127.0.0.1:51793 - \"OPTIONS /api?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhttpbin.org%2Fget%3Fx%3D87738 HTTP/1.1\" 200 OK\nINFO:     127.0.0.1:51793 - \"GET /api?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhttpbin.org%2Fget%3Fx%3D87738 HTTP/1.1\" 200 OK\n\n``` thanks a ton [@carlton](/u/carlton) and to all the TAs. Performed much better in ROE than I expected! ! ROE was challenging, but definitely Mocks helped a lot. I think mocks were the best preparation for ROE. Did good because of it. Your answer is absolutely correct [@23f2000573](/u/23f2000573)  \nBut the problem is you had to submit the answer rounded off to 3 decimal places. A decimal more or less would result in a wrong answer. Hello Sir\"s, [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh\\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)\n\nI was able to successfully attempt only 5 questions within the time limit. But due to internet issues, I could not submit exactly at 1:45pm. My last submission was at 1:47pm. But if there was a auto save then you could already check my answers were in the portal. I request you to please consider submission delays of 2-3 mins as this was due a technical glitches. And we too are switching tabs and running in vscode  \n```markdown\n### Image Description\n\nThe image displays a portion of a user interface, highlighting a section titled \"Recent saves\" in a bold, dark font. Below the title, there is a button labeled \"Reload\" in a light blue box with blue text. Additionally, there is a timestamp indicated as \"from 3/2/2025, 1:47:43 PM.\" The background of the image appears to be a light green color. ```\n\nKind Regards,  \nMuthu Hi [@Muthupalaniappan](/u/muthupalaniappan)  \nWe have got multiple issues like from other students, we are looking into it and figuring out what all we can do. Even I had this issue but it was given in question to round off so once rounded off, i would taken as correct Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton)  \n[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) as I already showed you in the meet that while submitting it was already showing 10, and for surety and safety i clicked on SAVE Button, on resaving now it’s showing 0 and dint get submitted properly…\n\nAs you can see from your records, I have already finished and submitted everything correctly. This carries a lot of weight and will significantly impact my grade, therefore I kindly ask that you take this into account and give me full marks. So i beg you sir for considering my request sir, also attaching the screenshot as you instructed in the meet for your reference sir. # Image Description\n\n- **Context**: The screenshot appears to be from an online exam platform or portal related to a test or assignment. - **Header**: The top of the page indicates that the exam's end time is on **Sunday, March 2, 2025, at 1:45 PM IST**. - **Bonus Mark Section**:\n  - A red banner prompts users to fill out a form before 5 PM IST to receive a bonus mark, specifically indicating it is for IITM students."

Thanks & Regards  \nDigvijaysinh Chudasama Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) / [@Saransh\\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)\n\nI tried submitting my exam at 3:14 AM EST, but my browser reloaded unexpectedly. I ended up re-entering my answers and submitted at 3:15:46 AM. I had completed eight questions (8 marks) well before the time, but got stuck on the last two. ```markdown\n## User Information\n\n- **Logged in as:** 22f1000535@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\n- **Logout button:** [Logout]\n\n## Recent Saves\n**(most recent is your official score)**\n\n- [Reload] from **3/2/2025**, **3:16:50 AM**. **Score:** 8\n- [Reload] from **3/2/2025**, **3:15:46 AM**. **Score:** 8\n```\n\nI understand I should have submitted more frequently, but those final 5 minutes flew by like the fastest 5 minutes of my life.

In my today’s ROE exam I forgot to click the save button. My score initially was 6/10. I was tackling another question and by that time the timer went off. I can even send my answers if required. I should have submitted more frequently, but I was busy solving the other questions for extra marks. Could you please consider my request? Thank you. Major betrayal - laptop, shut down like 5 times during the test losing 10 solid minutes, i think we should have atleast 1 hour from next term onwards ```markdown\n# Image Description\n\nThe image displays a web page with the following features:\n\n- **Header Section**: \n  - Displays a message indicating that an exam ended on **Sunday, 2 March 2025, at 1:45 PM IST**. - Contains a score indicating **0**. - Includes a button labeled **Check a report**. - Has a 'Login' button beneath the header. - **Main Section**:\n  - A dark-themed panel labeled **Recent saves** with the note that the most recent entry is the official score. - Features three buttons labeled **Reload** next to time stamps and scores:\n    - **Entry 1**: from **3/2/2025, 1:41:37 PM**, Score: **10**\n    - **Entry 2**: from **3/2/2025, 1:41:37 PM**, Score: **10**\n    - **Entry 3**: from **3/2/2025, 1:41:33 PM**, Score: **10**\n```\n\n  \nSir, I’m facing the same issue. While the recent scores say I have a score of 10, my final score shows 0. Kindly look into this, and please consider the highest marks from recent saves. Thank you. The same happened to me before the exam. Fortunately, I saw it before, and charged my laptop. Charging wasnt an issue for me, my entire vsc just froze and the screen went blank during the last 5 mins. That was exactly when i got the code for q6 and was trying to get the output and it froze, reopened at 1:45 and the time was up Hi [@23f2000778](/u/23f2000778)\n\nNo need to worry about that, I have checked in backend your score is 10 of 10.\n\nkind regards Hi [@21f3002158](/u/21f3002158)\n\nI looked for your result in backend, seems like you didn’t click to submit button throughout the exam. Since roe exam portal was similar to GA’s where you need to save answers using save button, after saving only your answers get evaluated and you get answers. There is no way other than pressing save button, we can’t do any help with this. Kind regards Hi [@21f2000588](/u/21f2000588) ,\n\nI looked in backend for your answers following are your submissions\n\n| Quiz | Email | Time | Total | Max |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| tds-2025-01-roe | roe-21f2000588@ds.study.iitm.ac.in | 2025-03-02 13:42:55 | 0 | 10 |\n| tds-2025-01-roe | roe-21f2000588@ds.study.iitm.ac.in | 2025-03-02 13:42:34 | 0 | 10 |\n| tds-2025-01-roe | roe-21f2000588@ds.study.iitm.ac.in | 2025-03-02 13:21:26 | 10 | 10 |\n| tds-2025-01-roe | roe-21f2000588@ds.study.iitm.ac.in | 2025-03-02 13:20:01 | 10 | 10 |\n| tds-2025-01-roe | roe-21f2000588@ds.study.iitm.ac.in | 2025-03-02 13:17:02 | 9 | 10 |\n| tds-2025-01-roe | roe-21f2000588@ds.study.iitm.ac.in | 2025-03-02 13:12:45 | 0 | 10 |\n| tds-2025-01-roe | roe-21f2000588@ds.study.iitm.ac.in | 2025-03-02 13:12:35 | 0 | 10 |\n| tds-2025-01-roe | roe-21f2000588@ds.study.iitm.ac.in | 2025-03-02 13:00:08 | 0 | 10 |\n\nWe will consider your submission of 10 marks since that’s maximum one.

Hi [@Muthupalaniappan](/u/muthupalaniappan)\n\nWe have decided to give 2 minutes of allowance for network problems to everyone, so whoever submitted before 1:47:00 will be evaluated, your submission was at 2025-03-02 13:47:43 with 2 marks\n\nKind regard [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir, I got disconnected at around 1:35 due to a network glitch and had to restart my uv server as well collab which wasted around 5 min and my score was around 7 and further I ran multiple scripts which I had already saved as code snippets as part of GA for question 4 on vs code and Collab and finally got the answer but I exceeded the time limit since the submission I made was at 1:47:28 which was 9…so I request to please consider that  \nOverall the ROE was a great experience and I wholly enjoyed the process\n\nThank you for giving us this amazing opportunity  \n\n```markdown\n# Exam Results Page\n\n**Exam Information:**\n- Ended at: Sun, 2 Mar 2025, 1:45 PM IST\n- Score: 9/10\n\n**Instructions:**\nPlease fill out [this form](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/ids-2025-01-roe) before 5 PM IST to receive a bonus mark.

Kind regards The questions were really similar to the GAs and mocks…I practiced them beforehand and had code snippets ready to use…so I guess that was helpful Ok sir  \nAlso I have realised the value of 28 seconds since my last submission (9/10) was at 1:47:28  \nI respect the rules of the exam and will be more careful in the future exams to avoid such technical glitches. Thank you Thank you so much [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) for taking time out and checking the records and considering my submission. It means a lot! Thanks & Regards,  \nDigvijaysinh Chudasama When I clicked the save button, it took an unusually long time to respond and eventually showed an error. There was no network issue, as other applications were working fine. However, the moment I clicked “Save,” all websites stopped loading, and my browser became unresponsive. I’m not sure what caused this problem, but I will share a screenshot to help diagnose the issue. ```markdown\n# Image Description\n\nThe image depicts a web interface, likely for an online exam or assessment tool. - **Timer:** A countdown timer at the top indicates \"00:04:19 left\". - **Score:** The current score is displayed as \"Score: 1/10\". - **Question Section:** \n  - A question asks about calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient between columns A and B. - There is a text input box for the user to enter their answer, labeled as \"Checking...\". - **Instructions:** \n  - Users are instructed to calculate the sample correlation coefficient using Python, Excel, or JavaScript, noting that there are no missing values and to provide the answer rounded to three decimal places (e.g., -0.769). - **Button:** \n  - A \"Check\" button is available to submit the answer. - **Error Message:** \n  - An error notification appears below the input box stating \"Error! Failed to fetch. Please contact the exam team for assistance.\" - A reminder is also present indicating to \"Save regularly. Your last saved submission will be evaluated.\" - **Visual Style:** The overall design features a dark interface with contrasting text and elements. ``` Hi [@23f2004781](/u/23f2004781)\n\nI looked for your submissions in backend and can’t find any submission. 23f2004781:\n\n> There was no network issue, as other applications were working fine. However, the moment I clicked “Save,” all websites stopped loading, and my browser became unresponsive. There was a technical support meeting going between 1 Pm to 1:50 pm on ROE day, you were expected to join that meeting. You didn’t join technical support meet before deadline. ```markdown\n### Image Description\n\nThe image features a dark background with a highlighted text box.

The text is in a light blue color, making it stand out against the darker background. ```\n\nEven on discourse we were continuously looking for new posts during ROE, you created discourse post at 2:3 PM which was after deadline so we can’t help with it. I have attempted all the questions in the ROE and solved few of the questions but i forgot to save the submission. At that time, I did not realize that I have not even saved once during the time. After realizing that i have not saved it in the evening, I have used the console to disable the save and saved my answers. Is it possible to validate it? I don’t have any submissions before 1:45pm. I realize that it is my mistake for not being careful about it but i request sir to be lenient about it as the project 1 was also difficult and i have my exams tomorrow. [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@iamprasna](/u/iamprasna) [@Saransh\\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) Hi [@Jayeshbansal](/u/jayeshbansal)\n\nUntil not clicked on save button answers get’s checked at frontend side only. There is no way we can validate it after deadline. I trust you would have solved few questions and also would have checked before deadline but clicking on save button was must to get submission evaluated. Kind regards i have not saved even once during the deadline but i have submitted/saved by hacking it in the evening when i realised that i have not saved it, i am asking you to consider that as i really don’t have any saves before deadline which will result me 0 marks, my request is to accept post deadline save by being lenient about it else i will get 0 marks. I will be satisfied even if you consider my 2nd save rather than latest save. (1st save was a sample test to check if possible, so it was 0 marks but the 2nd save is under 1-2 min which may prove that i have done all that questions before) Hi [@Jayeshbansal](/u/jayeshbansal)\n\nAfter deadline we gave allowance for 2 minutes considering network issues students might have faced, so till 1:47:00 all submissions will be considered valid, after that we won’t take any submissions. Following are your submissions all of them were after deadline\n\n| Quiz | Email | Time | Total | Max |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| tds-2025-01-roe | roe-24f1001895@ds.study.iitm.ac.in | 2025-03-02 19:29:49 | 9 | 10 |\n| tds-2025-01-roe | roe-24f1001895@ds.study.iitm.ac.in | 2025-03-02 19:26:52 | 8 | 10 |\n| tds-2025-01-roe | roe-24f1001895@ds.study.iitm.ac.in | 2025-03-02 19:26:48 | 8 | 10 |\n| tds-2025-01-roe | roe-24f1001895@ds.study.iitm.ac.in | 2025-03-02 19:25:36 | 0 | 0 |\n\nKind regards Hello sir, [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  \nDo you mean you will not consider them for evaluation then? Yes, it won’t be considered. yes, as you can see my first save is at 7:25 which was a trial check if post submission is working or not but you can see that the 2nd and 3rd are saved in approx 1 minute but i got 8 corrects which proves that i have done it before only. the latest save got 9 marks as i forgot to run the fastapi server for 1st mark which resulted me 3 more minutes. So, I request sir to consider any one of the saves except the first save Sorry [@Jayeshbansal](/u/jayeshbansal) All your submissions were around 7 hours after 1:47:00 Pm, that’s why we won’t consider them for evaluation. Kind regards Hi [@23f3002537](/u/23f3002537)  \nThe problem is that, here you are sending headers unnecessary and overwriting the original headers. Moreover you were returning the text of the response instead of the json. Here is the revised version. ```\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException\nfrom fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware\nimport httpx\nimport uvicorn\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n# Add CORS middleware to handle preflight OPTIONS requests\napp.add_middleware(\n    CORSMiddleware,\n    allow_origins=[\"*\"],\n    allow_credentials=True,\n    allow_methods=[\"*\"],\n    allow_headers=[\"*\"],\n)\n\n@app.get(\"/api\")\nasync def proxy(url: str, request: Request):\n    headers = {key: value for key, value in request.headers.items() if key.lower() != \"host\"}\n    try:\n        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:\n            response = await client.get(url)\n            return response.json()\n    except httpx.RequestError as e:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f\"Request failed: {str(e)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    uvicorn.run(app, host=\"127.0.0.1\", port=8000)\n\n``` Hello [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir,\n\nWill it be possible to consider only the minutes. I also cannot control the technical delays. I raised the point as fast as possible and I also joined the technical GMEET and exited when a different person raised the same question. I would dearly propose to consider still 1:47. But if it’s 1:48 you can ofcourse not consider it. But the “seconds” is something unrealistic. Please re consider this request sir. [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) Could you please verify if my score will be accepted by you? I saved only once: at 1:47 pm. My roll number is 21f2001573. [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  \nWhen will the results of ROE will out. Probably, by this week I checked your submission, its at 1:47:30 PM. We are going to give a grace period of 2 minutes past 1:45 PM. Given that you submitted 30 seconds past 1:47, we won’t be able to consider it. Regards Please reconsider this decision. In the heat of the moment, I failed to save. In my mind, I was sure that I had saved it. There is one other student with the same problem ( saved a few seconds after 1:47). Since I did only one save, I would get zero marks if the score is not considered. I didn’t submit any new answer after 1:45 pm. Please reconsider if possible. [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton) Thank you, much appreciated. Hi [@Yogesh1](/u/yogesh1) [@24f2003130](/u/24f2003130) [@Muthupalaniappan](/u/muthupalaniappan)\n\nQuick update: I discussed with internal team we are now giving an allowance till 1:48:00. Kind regards Hi [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir,\n\nI sincerely appreciate the extension and the understanding from the course team. This really means a lot, and I am truly grateful for the support. Thank you for your time and effort in making this possible. Kind regards,  \nShambhavi Verma Thanks a lot for this. 9 posts were merged into an existing topic: [Programming Quiz 1 - showing absent](/t/programming-quiz-1-showing-absent/169369/4) [@24f2003130](/u/24f2003130) [@23f1002630](/u/23f1002630) [@23f2004169](/u/23f2004169) [@22f3001272](/u/22f3001272)\n\nThey only started pushing the scores a few minutes ago, so just wait for the update to finish. Check again and confirm after a few hours. Thanks Am facing the same issue sir, will wait a few hours and update… I ensured I submitted atleast 5 times till 1:45 I submitted 5 times minimum before 1:45 with a score of 7 [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton) out of curiosity i also submitted thrice after exam at like 2 or so just to know how to solve the other qs withscore of 9. I will get the 7 considered right? I submitted them at like 1:43 or so. Please confirm. It still shows absent [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)\n\nDo we get bonus marks for submitting the student feedback Google Form? Sir , it is still showing absent for me for Roe result, I had submitted before the deadline as well my score was 2/10 but the result is showing absent. Can u please look into this and revert Any updates sir ? [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) It was told, it will be updated in a few hours and now it’s been a day. Am scared! Dont worry, we have the right scores on our server. There has been some problem in sending the export to the operations team. Your scores are safe. We are working on figuring out the problem. Even the bonus marks are recorded. Just give us a couple of days to sort it out. Many students have been affected so we cant give individual responses right now. Its a system fix that needs to be implemented. Respected Sir,\n\nI noticed that my status is still marked as absent. I understand I may be a bit impatient, but I wanted to clarify my submission. I had submitted the ROE on time before 1:45 PM, though I was unaware that submissions were allowed until 1:47 PM. Even after the deadline, I attempted to increase my marks upon learning about the method to unlock the ROE. While I did make changes after the deadline, my initial submission before 1:45 PM had already secured some marks, meaning I was not absent. Additionally, I recall you mentioning in Project 1 that students should focus on the learning experience rather than just the marks when someone said that this term’s project was tougher than the last. Even if my increased marks were obtained after the deadline, they were still achieved by following all the given instructions and on my own terms and also everyone has different questions. If those changes were submitted in the same manner, I am unsure why they are not being considered. I understand it’s my mistake that I was not able to solve the entire ga in time but I had conditions which I had submitted in the feedback google form. Since this is a standalone degree for me, I’m actually worried about it. When I learned how to unlock the ROE, I completed it in a very short time. Please consider the top marks even when did after the normal deadline as marks still got submitted  \nrollnumber 23f2001390 ```markdown\n## Image Description\n\nThe image consists of a table with two rows and four columns. Each row represents an entry with the following details:\n\n1. **Email Address**: \n   - `23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` (appears in both rows)\n   \n2. **Timestamp**: \n   - First row: `2025-03-02 17:51:08`\n   - Second row: `2025-03-02 13:45:05`\n\n3. **Number**:\n   - First row: `4`\n   - Second row: `3`\n   \nThe background is a light gray, and the text is displayed in a standard font style. ```\n\nThe latest submission before the deadline would be 3 marks. That is what would be considered. Ok sir will the bonus 1 mark also be included for filling the gform, also I had scored 10 later is that also there or only 4 max is present? yes 1 bonus will be added if you filled the form according to the instructions.
