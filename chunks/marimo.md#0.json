  "content": "## Interactive Notebooks: Marimo\n\n[Marimo](https://marimo.app/) is a new take on notebooks that solves some headaches of Jupyter. It runs cells reactively - when you change one cell, all dependent cells update automatically, just like a spreadsheet. Marimo's cells can't be run out of order. This makes Marimo more reproducible and easier to debug, but requires a mental shift from the Jupyter/Colab way of working. It also runs Python directly in the browser and is quite interactive. [Browse the gallery of examples](https://marimo.io/gallery). With a wide variety of interactive widgets, It's growing popular as an alternative to Streamlit for building data science web apps. Common Operations:\n\n```python\n# Create new notebook\nuvx marimo new\n\n# Run notebook server\nuvx marimo edit notebook.py\n\n# Export to HTML\nuvx marimo export notebook.py\n```\n\nBest Practices:\n\n1. **Cell Dependencies**\n   - Keep cells focused and atomic\n   - Use clear variable names\n   - Document data flow between cells\n2. **Interactive Elements**\n\n   ```python\n   # Add interactive widgets\n   slider = mo.ui.slider(1, 100)\n   # Create dynamic Markdown\n   mo.md(f\"{slider} {\"ðŸŸ¢\" * slider.value}\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Version Control**\n   - Keep notebooks are Python files\n   - Use Git to track changes\n   - Publish on [marimo.app](https://marimo.app/) for collaboration\n\n[!
