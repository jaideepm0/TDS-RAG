Take it in your last semester if possible. - Plan extra time. It takes more than typical 3-credit courses. - LLMs grade you unpredictably. - The ROE is hard. ## Prerequisites\nYou need a **good understanding** of:\n- Python\n- JavaScript\n- HTML\n- HTTP\n- Excel\n- Data science concepts\n\n## Additional Information\n- Take Graded Assignment 1 to check if you’re ready for this course. - Consider dropping this course in a later term if you score low; it may be too tough for you now. - Programming skills are a prerequisite. - We encourage learning by sharing.
