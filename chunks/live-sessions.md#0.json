[TDS Live Sessions: Jan 2025](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/VTBwpPT3A3U/sddefault.webp)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_h5u1jMeBCl1BquBhgunA4t08XAxsA-C)\n\nThese were downloaded using [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp). The options compress the audio optimized for speech. ```bash\nyt-dlp --extract-audio --audio-format opus --embed-thumbnail --postprocessor-args \\\n  \"-c:a libopus -b:a 12k -ac 1 -application voip -vbr off -ar 8000 -cutoff 4000 -frame_duration 60 -compression_level 10\" \\\n  $YOUTUBE_URL\n```\n\nThey were then transcribed by Gemini 1.5 Flash 002 (currently the best model from a price-quality perspective for audio transcription). System prompt:\n\n```\nYou are an expert transcriber of data science audio tutorials\n```\n\nUser prompt:\n\n```\nTranscribe this audio tutorial about Tools in Data Science (TDS) as an FAQ. Summarize the student questions faithfully. Summarize the answers succinctly, without missing information, in a conversational style. Avoid repeating questions, consolidating similar ones. Prefer \"You\" and \"I\" instead of \"student\" and \"instructor\". For example:\n\n**Q1: [Concisely framed question]**\n\n**A1:** [Succinct answer]\n```"
