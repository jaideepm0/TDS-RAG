You can choose to repeat courses to improve the grade in the course. The highest grade will be recorded in the transcript. The total number of courses must be within the CCC limit. Course fee for Repeat for Improvement courses will be double the normal fee. Improvement courses can be registered at any level. Eg: Foundation course improvement can be registered at diploma level. **Note:** It is recommended that learners try and progress with new courses instead of repeating courses for improvement, unless a learner deems it absolutely necessary or needs to improve their learning of a course. All course material of completed courses is available to the learner throughout the course. ``` TDS is the worst subject to repeat in order to improve CGPA. Its better to take a high credit, easy course to improve CGPA. **We never recommend taking TDS for grade improvement. ** If you have passed it, its better to move on."
