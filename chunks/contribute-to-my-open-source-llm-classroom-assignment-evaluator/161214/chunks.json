    "content": "Dear all,\n\nI’m thrilled to share a project inspired by my experience in the \\*Tools in Data Science \\* course: [**LLM Classroom Assignment Evaluator**](https://github.com/AvinashShrivastav/LLM_Assignment_Evaluator_GoogleClassroom). This is the basic prototype. This tool leverages Google APIs and LLMs to automate grading and feedback for Google Classroom assignments, making evaluation faster and more insightful for educators. A heartfelt thanks to **[@s.anand](/u/s.anand)**, our course instructor, and TAs **[@Carlton](/u/carlton)** and **[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)**, whose guidance on LLM function calling and real-world applications made this project possible. I’d love to invite contributions from this amazing community to:\n\n* Expand functionality and evaluation models. * Fix bugs and optimize workflows. * Improve documentation for broader accessibility. The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AvinashShrivastav/LLM_Assignment_Evaluator_GoogleClassroom) is open for forks, pull requests, and ideas. I look forward to collaborating with you all! Update: here is a video explaining the process - <https://youtu.be/xa4zhP-S3NE?feature=shared>  \nBest regards,  \nAvinash Shrivastava Hi Avinash,\n\nThats great work! I am glad you were able to use what you learnt from the course for something so practical. I hope you continue to develop and refine it, take feedback from the stakeholders who would be interested in this approach. I see a lot of potential in this project. Kind regards Thanks [@carlton](/u/carlton)  I would definitely refine it. Testing… please ignore"
