Inside each student's folder, there are multiple assignment folders (`Assignment_X`). Each assignment contains:\n- A `.txt` file with the question statement. - A corresponding `.py`, `.sh`, or `.js` file for the solution. ### Example Directory Structure\nRollNo_12345/\n├── Assignment_1/\n│   ├── Q1.txt    # Question for Q1\n│   ├── Q1.py     # Solution in Python\n│   ├── Q2.txt    # Question for Q2\n│   ├── Q2.sh     # Solution in Bash\n│   ├── Q3.txt    # Question for Q3\n│   ├── Q3.js     # Solution in JavaScript\n├── Assignment_2/\n\n```\n\nThis file has been truncated.

Hi [@23f1002382](/u/23f1002382)\n\nGreat initiative, will be happy to see lot of PR’s on your repo. Jivraj:\n\n> e, will be happy to see lot of PR’s on your re\n\nWill   \nHopefully   \n… Already did a PR although it was a minor formatting one xDD yeah thanks that helped a lot actually"
