[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@dshail](/u/dshail) We have your weekly scores as  \n75.0, 100.0, 89.5, 70.0 on our back end server\n\nWe will update the dashboard and thanks for brining it to our attention. Kind regards because the previous score that you received was what you scored after the deadline. We had accidentally given students marks to students who submitted after the deadline. Here is the evidence. ```markdown\n| Quiz            | Email                       | Time                | Total | Max |\n|-----------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|-------|-----|\n| tds-2025-01-ga3 | 2113000745@ds.study.iitm.ac.in | 2025-02-06 18:53:58 | 7     | 9.5 |\n| tds-2025-01-ga3 | 2113000745@ds.study.iitm.ac.in | 2025-02-05 22:01:38 | 6     | 9.5 |\n```\n\n  \nKind regards [@24ds3000061](/u/24ds3000061) I can confirm that you have 20 and 30 for weeks 2 and week 4 on our back end server. We will fix it in dashboard and thanks for brining it to our attention. Kind regards [@HARISH.S](/u/harish.s) I can confirm that our back end server has recorded these scores for you 87.5, 65, 90 for week 1 , 2 and 4\n\nWe will fix it in the dashboard, and thanks for bringing it to our attention. Kind regards [@AnvithaV](/u/anvithav) I can confirm that you have\n\n5.0, 55.0, 73.7, 100.0 in weeks 1,2 ,3,4 respectively on our backend server. We will fix it in dashboard, thanks for bringing it to our attention. Kind regards [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir,  \nI recently checked my marks for Tool in Data Science and noticed a major discrepancy.

The actual score is 85 in Module 1. Ignore seek portal, because scores are evaluated externally on our server. Those scores on seek portal are just from the placeholder question that asked whether you saw GA1 and attempted it. It has no bearing on your actual marks. The actual score will be in the dashboard soon. Kind regards. Sir for the GA3 the saved score says its 4.5, total is 9.5 so my total should be 47.4. [@23f1002223](/u/23f1002223)\n\n```markdown\n## Image Description\n\nThe image contains a table with three rows and several columns. The data appears to be related to submissions or assessments associated with an academic or educational context. The columns include:\n\n- **Identifier**: The first column starts with \"tds-2025-01-ga3\", which seems to be an identifier for a specific assignment or course. - **Email Address**: The second column shows the same email address \"23f100223@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\" for each entry. - **Timestamp**: The third column lists different timestamps:\n  - 2025-02-06 00:13:34\n  - 2025-02-06 00:22:25\n  - 2025-02-05 23:59:07\n- **Scores**: The fourth column contains numerical scores:\n  - 4.5\n  - 4.5\n  - 3.5\n- **Max Score**: The last column consistently shows a maximum score of 9.5. The table is organized and displays entries likely corresponding to submissions or evaluations within a specific timeframe, showcasing the related scores. ```\n\nAccording to your submission history your last submission before the deadline was 3.5 (i.e. your score would be 36.8 out of 100)\n\nKind regards [@carlton](/u/carlton), the error has been rectified, and the corrected mark has now been accurately reflected in the system. # Image Description\n\nThe image displays a web interface related to an assignment platform. The main features include:\n\n- **Status Alert**: A red banner indicating the assignment has ended, with a timestamp of \"Sun, 2 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST\" and a score displayed as \"0\". - **User Information**: A section showing the user is logged in with the ID `22f1001901@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. - **Recent Saves**: A section listing recent saves with the following entries:\n  - **From**: 2/3/2025, 12:00:30 AM, Score: 8\n  - **From**: 2/2/2025, 11:53:32 PM, Score: 8\n  - **From**: 2/2/2025, 11:53:30 PM, Score: 8\n- **Questions Section**: A part labeled \"Questions\" with the first item referring to \"Write documentation in Markdown (1 mark)\". The background is predominantly dark with elements highlighted in blue and green. Sorry for the late upload but as you can see in the screenshot i had submitted answers for TDS Week 2 graded assignment but it shows 0 both here and in current courses tab. I did reload the recent tab before uploading and for tds ga submission i submit and keep the tab open until the timer runs out. [@shubham6](/u/shubham6) I have checked the backend server. It does show your score as 8 for GA2, so we have the correct score for you. Can you send me a screenshot of your dashboard (where your course cards are) thanks. Kind regards"
