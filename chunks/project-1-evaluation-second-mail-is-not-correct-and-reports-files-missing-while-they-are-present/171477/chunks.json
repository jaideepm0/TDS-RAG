    "content": "Mail I received Yesterday:  \n\n```markdown\n# Project 1 Prerequisite Checks\n\nDear Learner,\n\nProject 1 requires you to pass some pre-requisite checks as detailed on the [TDS Project 1: Evaluation](link) page:\n\n1. Your GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible. 2. Your GitHub repository has a LICENSE file with the MIT license. 3. Your GitHub repository has a valid Dockerfile. 4. Your Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME. 5. Your Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in your GitHub repository. If you fail to meet this minimum requirement, your submission will not get evaluated. ## Project 1 Prerequisite Evaluations:\n\n- Is Docker image present in Docker Hub AND is public: **PASS**\n- Is GitHub repo present AND public: **FAIL**\n- Is Dockerfile present in root of GitHub repo: **FAIL**\n- Is MIT license present at root of GitHub repo: **FAIL**\n```\n\nPrevious Correct Evaluation Mail:  \n\n```markdown\n# Evaluation of Project 1: Docker Image Submission\n\n**Dear Learner,**\n\nWe have evaluated your project 1 docker image submission. Please find the following files. - **MISSING** indicates that the file is not available because the evaluation did not run or the docker image was misconfigured. If you feel this is in error, you can still contact us. Your docker image is supposed to become responsive in 5 minutes from launch. If it does not, then we will not consider it. The image was run on an 8-core Xeon Google Cloud compute unit. So, performance of the server was not a bottleneck for your docker image. Also, each docker image had 1 Gigabit of dedicated network bandwidth available which is nearly 5 times faster than the fastest domestic internet. ### Evaluation Logs\n\n1. **Evaluation log file:** [Link](https://example.com/evaluation-log)\n   - Contains your performance report on your individual tasks. 2. **Docker log file:** [Link](https://example.com/docker-log)\n   - Provides the technical performance of your container. 3. **Server start log:** (separate logs for arm v8 & x86)\n   - If your docker service did not start on request, the logs will clarify our requests. 4. **Evaluation script file:** (see attachments)\n   - The evaluation and grading process on this file to raise queries for these tasks. 5. **Execution plan file:** (see attachment)\n   - Handles the retrieval of your docker image from Docker Hub and launching of your container instance. It also sends the required environment variables that will be used to run your container and help provide logs for communications. 6. **Solution script:** (see attachment)\n   - This solves the entire project using prompt engineering only. This is a sample example of what can be achieved by leveraging the core concepts of LLMs to achieve the desired result. ### Docker Image ID\nThis is the ID of the docker image that was evaluated: `429984671b6b`\n\nThese scores are not final but they indicate what our current evaluation standards will score you. If you have discovered a bug in our scripts or have a discrepancy to report with how the various scripts functions then we are happy to address your concern and where necessary make amendments to your score. You will have until *Tuesday* to report any problems, after which the score will be considered final. We will listen to feedback and then come up with a fair marking schema. We will also look at the highest scores (including the score of the sample script we shared) to decide the mark on which the rest of the scores will be normalized. We look forward to your feedback and apologize for the delay in providing you with the scores. **Post all your concerns on this discussion thread. **\n```\n\nGood Morning Sir,\n\nThis is my github repo: [GitHub - kohliaryan/TDS\\_Project\\_1](https://github.com/kohliaryan/TDS_Project_1) ()You can verify that it is public, MIT License is present and Dockerfile is also present.) I also got a mail 2 days ago in which everything is mentioned correctly but the mail I got yesterday worry me. Sir, I have worked really hard for project 1. Please look into this matter. [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) Sir, Please look into in this matter, no reply from your side till now and 2 days have been passed. Apologies for that,\n\nThe second email was an automated script that used a stricter criteria. You have passed evaluation and also have a score. So dont worry. We will push scores over this weekend. We are currently doing normalisation. Kind regards Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton),\n\nI’m experiencing the same issue mentioned in this thread regarding Project 1 evaluation emails:\n\n1. The first email I received confirmed all requirements were met (public repo, MIT License, Dockerfile, etc.) 2. The second email incorrectly flagged missing files despite their presence in my repository\n\nHere are screenshots of both emails showing the discrepancy:\n\n```markdown\n# Email Description\n\n**Subject:** TDS Jan 25 Project 1 Scores  \n**Date:** March 29, 2023, 12:12 AM\n\n\nThis is the ID of the docker image that was evaluated: **b03b89ee0b17**\n\nThese scores are not final but they indicate what our current evaluation standards will score you. If you have discovered a bug in our scripts or have a discrepancy to report with how the various scripts functions then we are happy to address your concern and where necessary make amendments to your score. We will allow next Tuesday to report any problems. After which the score will be considered final. We will listen to feedback and then come up with a final marking schema. ```\n\n  \n\n# Email Summary\n\n**Subject:** TDS Jan 25 Project 1 Scores  \n**From:** 221l se2002 <se2002@study.iitm.ac.in>  \n**Date:** Tue, Apr 1, 1:25 AM (3 days ago) Hi,\n\nPrerequisite checks have passed. But your docker image was missing a dependency that you forgot to copy into the image. so it failed to evaluate because it failed to run. You talking about me or [@23f2000345](/u/23f2000345) ? Good Morning Sir, Actually even I got the mail regarding Project-1 Evaluation, where I got the message like the prerequisites were not met. But, sir actually I have uploaded my MIT License file, requirements.txt file, my Project.py file and the Dockerfile. Sir, and when I sent a request to my API from my device, it worked sir. I have got 0 in my project 1 sir, but I have met the pre-requisites Can you please check this once sir? My GitHub repository for Project-1: [GitHub - sudhishssn134/project\\_1\\_tds](https://github.com/sudhishssn134/project_1_tds)\n\nThanking You\n\nJust attaching the mail I recieved. # Image Description\n\nThe image is an email regarding a project score assessment for \"TDS Jan 25 Project 1.\" It is addressed to \"Dear Learner\" and details the evaluation of a Docker image submission. ## Key Points from the Email:\n\n1. **Missing Files**: \n   - Indicates that certain files are missing due to evaluation issues or misconfiguration. 2. **Docker Image Performance**: \n   - The Docker image should be responsive within five minutes of launch. If not, it won’t be evaluated. 3. **Attachments**:\n   - There are multiple attachments mentioned:\n     - Evaluation log. - Docker log for performance metrics. - Server start log. - A separate evaluation script. - Data generation file. - Docker orchestration file. - A solution script. 4. **Image ID**: \n   - The email includes an ID for the evaluated Docker image: `738327227180`. 5. **Evaluation Standards**: \n   - The scores provided indicate that the current evaluation standards may not be met. The email appears to be a communication about performance metrics and necessary action points for project improvement. Your Dockerfile was misconfigured. When we try to build the docker image from your github repo, we get this error:\n\n`tried copying parent folder(COPY failed: forbidden path outside the build context: .. ())`\n\nYou have to replicate the test environment. If it works when you follow this test setup then you should get in touch with us. [Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/316) [Tools in Data Science](/c/courses/tds-kb/34)\n\n> To replicate the test environment:\n> Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that. You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can run this code using uv. > # /// script\n> # dependencies = [\n> # \"requests\",\n> # ]\n> # ///\n> import requests\n> import datetime as dt\n> import zoneinfo\n> import argparse\n> import os\n> import zipfile\n> parser = argparse.… Oh OK Sir. I will try it out. Thank You so much sir Sir, I have extracted the files from the GitHub Repository, built my DockerFile withe the DockerImage I have posted. The build is successful and the dockerimage is also running sir. I have attached the screen shot below  \n\n```markdown\n# Docker Build Log\n\nThis image displays a terminal output from a Docker build process. Key points include:\n\n- **SHA Digest Tracking**: Various SHA256 hashes are shown for layers being extracted and exported. - **Directory Operations**:\n  - `WORKDIR /app`: Sets the working directory to `/app`. - `COPY .. /app`: Copies files into the container. - `COPY requirements.txt /app`: Copies the requirements.txt file. - `RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`: Installs Python dependencies listed in the requirements file without using cache. - **Exporting Layers**: Each layer is being exported with corresponding SHA256 digests. - **Application Startup**:\n  - Indicates the application is starting, with a URL output for Uvicorn running at `http://0.0.0.0:8000`. - **Server Process Information**: Additional logging shows the status of the server process and the command used to run the Docker container. ### Note\n- The output suggests a successful build and potential application launch within a Docker container environment. ```\n\nSir, But I couldn’t run the last command you gave,\n\n```\nuv run evaluate.py --email <any email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000\n\n```\n\nAs I dont have evaluate.py\n\nBut, the DockerImage is built and is running without error sir. Please guide me after this sir  \nThank You So much sir"
