[Discover the Data - Summary](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/NNiFxgANu8Y/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/NNiFxgANu8Y)\n\nBased on what you have learnt in this module, you should be able to do two things: find data and understand what type of data it is. Both of these are powerful skills. The more data you are able to find, the more analysis that you will be able to do that others are unable to. Therefore, discovering new sources of data is a competitive advantage and a skill that is well worth building. The other, in terms of understanding the type of data, will give you an edge in terms of knowing which data set is easier to work with. Structured data is easier to work with because you don't have to do any additional work. You don't have to extract information from it. Numerical values are easier to work with than, let's say, categorical or composite because there's less effot to extract the structure. So you'll be able to compare two data sets and say that one gets more results by spending in less time and effort. ## Sample questions\n\n- Find the UCI machine learning dataset on Wine Quality. (It has 4,898 rows.) What is the highest pH value of the red wines? (ANS: 4.01)\n- What's the official data portal of Russia? (ANS: <https://data.gov.ru/?language=en>)\n- Are research papers structured, semi-structured or unstructured? (ANS: Semi-structured. They have author names, abstracts, keywords, etc. but most content is free-form.) - Are book titles categorical or composite? (ANS: Categorical. They don't have an underlying structure.) ## Optional: Tools used in the industry\n\nKathir Mani from QueLit and Anand S from Gramener discuss the tools and technologies used in the industry.

Now, when was the post with ID `2921983` posted? Specifically, What is the timestamp? (ANS: 1314211127)\n- Using [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), in the `sun-moon` version, find out how many moves `ivysaur` has that `bulbasaur` does not. (ANS: 1: leech-seed). - How many images (`<img>` tags) does this [White House page snapshot](https://web.archive.org/web/20110101070603id_/https://www.whitehouse.gov/) have inside a link (`<a>` element)? (ANS: 15)\n- What is the westernmost point (highest longitude) on the bounding box of `Baghdad, Iraq`, according to the Nominatim API? If there are multiple matches, get the highest longitude across all bounding boxes. (ANS: 44.969Â°E)\n- What CSS selector would you use to extract the last list element with a class `highlight` from an unordered list? (ANS: `ul li.highlight:last-child`)\n\n## Smart Narratives with Power BI\n\n[!
