    "content": "Sir,\n\nThe License file is present in the github repository however i received a mail that said that it was absent. # Image Description\n\nThe image displays a GitHub repository interface for a project named `tds_project-1`. It is set to public and is currently on the main branch. Here are the key details visible in the image:\n\n- **Repository Information:**\n  - Project name: `tds_project-1`\n  - Branch: main\n  - Tags: 0 Tags\n  - Number of branches: 1\n  - Button options: \"Add file\" and a dropdown for \"Code\" options. - **File List:**\n  - Files are listed with their names and the most recent commit message:\n    - `__pycache__` - (no commit message)\n    - `venv` - (no commit message)\n    - `Dockerfile` - \"First submission\"\n    - `LICENSE` - \"Create LICENSE\"\n    - `MIT LICENSE` - \"Rename LICENSE to MIT LICENSE\"\n    - `app.py` - \"Final Submission\"\n    - `requirements.txt` - \"First submission\"\n    - `test.txt` - \"First submission\"\n\n- **Most Recent Commit:**\n  - Commit ID: 22f300058\n  - Commit message: \"Create LICENSE\"\n  - Time: \"now\" (indicates the latest updates have just been made). This summary outlines the structure and recent activity of the project repository detailed in the image. ```markdown\n### Project 1 Prerequisite Evaluations\n\nIf you fail to meet this minimum requirement your submission will not get evaluated. - **Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public:** PASS\n- **Is Github repo present AND public:** PASS\n- **Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo:** PASS\n- **Is MIT license present at root of github repo:** FAIL\n\n**Prerequisites:** FAIL  \n**Project 1 Score:** 0\n```\n\nSir I thought that the ‘LICENSE’ file had to be renamed to ‘MIT LICENSE’. Can you please look into it. Thankyou! Hi [@22f3000585](/u/22f3000585)\n\nStandard MIT License naming criteria is to be named as LICENSE or LICENSE.md(all caps). [Adding a license to a repository - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository)\n\nKind regards ```markdown\n### Image Description\n\nThe image contains a message regarding the failure of a GitHub repository submission. It states:\n\n- The submission link: `https://github.com/22f3000585/tds_project-1.git`\n- The result is categorized as \"FAIL\" with the following reasons listed:\n  - No such repository\n  - No \"MIT\" in LICENSE\n  - No Dockerfile\n```\n\n  \nSir, this is why i renamed it to ‘MIT LICENSE’. Sir can you please consider it. Thank you! Same here. I also added and saved the file as MIT license because of the following message. I request you to please consider evaluating the project. ```markdown\n### Document Overview\n\n- **Header**: \n  - No \"MIT\" in LICENSE; No Dockerfile\n\n- **Instructions**: \n  - Ensure that your submission passes the above checklist for it to be considered for scoring. - **Note**: \n  - Only the latest submissions have been considered, as students were allowed to submit more than once. ``` [@24ds2000125](/u/24ds2000125) [@22f3000585](/u/22f3000585)\n\nI completely appreciate that you feel these are minor issues. But the team has decided that we cannot allow students to make changes to their repos. Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly. Unfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites. Changing it now will not suddenly make it eligible. These things do matter when done at scale. Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter. Its a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it. We had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page. I know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why. Kindest regards Sir,  \nThankyou for your prompt reply to my query. I wanted to let you know that i had made change of ‘LICENSE’ to ‘MIT LICENSE’ on the 16th of Feb itself as that was the day that i had received the mail and because I saw that the submission date had been extended by one day(i.e the 16th of Feb itself). I completely understand what you are trying to convey but that was the sole reason i made that change on the 16th. I completely respect your decision but if there is even a slight possibility that you consider it (only because I did it on the 16th) I would highly appreciate it. Thankyou! One thing we are doing is looking at the latest commit before the 18th of Feb. So if it was correct before the 18th of Feb then we will consider it and evaluate it, but it has to be precisely what is expected. If so, then your submission will be evaluated by building the image from the docker manifest in the github present at the version before the 18th. Well noted sir. Thanks a lot! Sir, I received the mail today -  \n\n```markdown\n# Pre-requisites Check\n\n**Results:** (1 for pass, 0 for fail)\n\n- **Docker repo exists and is public** (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): **1**\n- **Github repo exists and is public** (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): **1**\n- **Github repo check** - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): **0**\n- **Github repo check** - Dockerfile exists: **1**\n```\n\n  \nSir, I had already added the LICENSE and changed it to’MIT LICENSE’ due to this reason before the deadline itself. ```markdown\n## Image Description\n\nThe image contains a message indicating that a submission to a GitHub repository has failed. The URL of the repository is provided:\n\n- **Repository URL:** [https://github.com/22f3000585/tds_project-1.git](https://github.com/22f3000585/tds_project-1.git)\n  \nThe reasons for the failure are highlighted as follows:\n\n- No such repository\n- No `MIT` in `LICENSE`\n- No `Dockerfile`\n```\n\n  \nSir,the rest of my prerequistes are working well.Can you please check as due to this my project has also not been evaluated.The MIT LICENSE file was already present in the github repo as I submitted my project’s github repo in the google form that was provided. ```markdown\n# Repository File Structure\n\n- **22f3000585**: Create LICENSE\n  - **Commit ID**: c61a6ef\n  - **Last Updated**: 5 days ago\n  - **Total Commits**: 6\n\n## Files and Folders\n- **Folder: __pycache__**\n  - **Status**: Final Submission\n  - **Last Update**: 2 months ago\n\n- **Folder: venv**\n  - **Status**: First Submission\n  - **Last Update**: 2 months ago\n\n- **File: Dockerfile**\n  - **Status**: First Submission\n  - **Last Update**: 2 months ago\n\n- **File: LICENSE**\n  - **Status**: Create LICENSE\n  - **Last Update**: 5 days ago\n\n- **File: MIT LICENSE**\n  - **Status**: Rename LICENSE to MIT LICENSE\n  - **Last Update**: 2 months ago\n\n- **File: app.py**\n  - **Status**: Final Submission\n  - **Last Update**: 2 months ago\n\n- **File: requirements.txt**\n  - **Status**: First Submission\n  - **Last Update**: 2 months ago\n\n- **File: test.txt**\n  - **Status**: First Submission\n  - **Last Update**: 2 months ago\n```\n\n  \nSir can you please check.
