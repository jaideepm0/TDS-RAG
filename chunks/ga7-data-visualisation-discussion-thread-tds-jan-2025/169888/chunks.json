    "content": "Dear Learner,\n\nThis is the discussion thread for [Graded Assignment 7](https://forms.gle/8AMCa4oQ8JnpzemY7). Please post any queries related to it here. Deadline: 2025-03-26T18:29:00Z Is it compulsory to use microsoft powerpoint? Can we use google slides? We will be using scripts to check the submissions. You will have to use PowerPoint. Kind regards Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton),  \nI was working on GA7 as part of Task 4 in 7.1. In task 4.Sheet1, the columns include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value. While I could extract Series ID and Item, I couldn’t locate Year, Month, or Value in the dataset. Could someone please assist me with this? ```markdown\n## PPI Industry Data Overview\n\n### Anticoagulants, Hemostatics, and Digitalis Preparations\n\n- **Series Title**: PPI industry data for Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing - Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations, not seasonally adjusted\n- **Series ID**: PCU2341232452217111\n- **Seasonality**: Not Seasonally Adjusted\n- **Survey Name**: PPI Industry Data\n- **Measure Data Type**: Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations\n- **Industry**: Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing\n- **Item**: Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations There is another dataset provided for the other records. # Image Description\n\nThe image appears to be a screenshot of an online form or document related to an assignment or project. Key elements include:\n\n## Heading\n- **Question 7.1**\n\n## Scenario\n- Describes a political party called \"Buddhi Daya Nyaay (BDN)\" analyzing the impact of pharmaceutical exports from India to the US. ## Data Figures\n- Mentions India's pharmaceutical exports for FY 2024 amounting to ₹2,42,888 Crores. ## Provided Files\n- Lists two files:\n  - **Industry Product Segment Information**\n  - **Monthly Price Indices for Segments (Two-year data)**\n\n## Tasks\n1. Instructions to create a new Google Sheet workbook named `ga.7.1.rollno` (with a specific format for naming). 2. Directs to share editing rights with a provided email address. 3. Advises that submissions must be in a specific format to be considered:\n   - **Sheet1**: Must have columns labeled Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value. - **Sheet2**: Must create a pivot table with specific configurations. Overall, the document is oriented towards guiding users through a data analysis task involving the pharmaceutical sector. Monthly Price Indices file have those columns. @[Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/Jivraj)\n\nIn the GA 7.1 part it is said that we need data of which columns are  \n```markdown\n## Image Description\n\nThe image contains text that reads:\n\n**4. Sheet1:** Columns include **Series ID, Item, Year, Month,** and **Value. **\n```\n\nbut the dataset provided has no column named “Item”  \n```markdown\n| Series ID           | Year | Period | Label      | Value   |\n|---------------------|------|--------|------------|---------|\n| PCU3254–3254       | 2023 | M01    | 2023 Jan   | 562.445 |\n| PCU3254–3254       | 2023 | M02    | 2023 Feb   | 565.948 |\n``` Thanks a lot for pointing out and sorry it’s my bad missed it. Item is there in other sheet we might have to join them to get items. We have to extract all id’s and their respective item from other sheet and add in first sheet with respect to id’s . [@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir I don’t have Microsoft PowerPoint. What should I do ? Use the free version on Microsoft 365 Below items don’t have prices. | PCU3254123254127111 | Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations |\n| --- | --- |\n| PCU3254123254127114 | Calcium channel blockers |\n| PCU325412325412MM | Miscellaneous receipts |\n| PCU325412325412D112OC | Other digestive or genito-urinary preparations, over-the-counter |\n| PCU325412325412D113 | Antacids |\n| PCU325412325412SS | Secondary products |\n| PCU3254123254127112 | ACE inhibitors |\n\nSome items don’t have prices for all 24 months. Although the assignment says 24 months (I assumed 2023 January to 2024 December) data, many items have prices for 2025 Jan as well. > [Monthly Price Indices for Segments (Two-year data)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OrkZgDnx7uYjOxFW2XDrA5F0xFre_PCS/view?usp=drive_link)\n\nShall I delete the records for which price is not available? ```markdown\n# Data Table Overview\n\nThe image shows a table containing various pharmaceutical items and their values over specific months in the year 2023. The relevant sections are highlighted for clarity. ## Table Structure\n\n- **Column A: Item Names**\n  - The first few items listed are:\n    - **ACE Inhibitors**\n    - Analgesics\n    - Analgesics, over-the-counter\n    - Analgesics, prescription\n    - Antacids\n    - Anti-acne preparations\n    - Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitals preparations\n    - And more...\n\n- **Columns B to H: Monthly Values for 2023**\n  - Column B indicates the year and month. - The total values for each month (M01 to M05) are provided alongside the total sum. - Many items have values while several categories show **0** for all months. ### Highlights\n\n- Sections marked with red arrows indicate key focus areas, specifically the \"ACE inhibitors\" and \"Antacids\" rows. - The month columns (M01 to M05) list numerical values representing quantities or financial amounts relevant to each item. ## Summary\n\nThis table serves as a quantitative overview of various medical and pharmaceutical items, showcasing the financial metrics across different months within the specified year. ```\n\n[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) How to give the access to power point slides with the edit option ? [@carlton](/u/carlton) Can you please advise regarding the ga.7.2 as the The current top 5 countries by GDP in 2014 from the dataset are actually aggregated economic groups (not individual countries). can i proceed with that or I need to filter only the individual countries once i submitted the answers. but when i clicked on edit response and it deleted all the submitted answers. What to do in this case [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) Hi Tanya,\n\nBoth you responses have been recorded. So it has not been deleted. Its just the way google forms works, it does not reload your previous responses. Kind regards The question asked for top 5 countries. So that would be the approach for this question, not aggregated economic groups. Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir,  \nI have received the bonus marks email with 5 additional HTML files for peer review. However, I noticed that one of these files was also included in the initial peer grading email. Could you please clarify if I should fill out the peer review form for this particular file again, or should I skip it since it has already been graded? ```markdown\n# Email Screenshot Description\n\nThe image shows a Gmail interface with the following details:\n\n- **Search Bar**: At the top, there is a search bar labeled with \"peer review.\" - **Email Labels**: \n  - The \"Mail\" tab is highlighted. - There are sections for \"Conversations,\" \"Spaces,\" \"From,\" and \"To.\" - The \"Has attachment\" option is visible. - An \"Advanced search\" link is present. - **Email Content**: \n  - The inbox contains various emails, with some grouped under timestamps. - Notable email subjects include:\n    - \"[TDS Jan 25] BONUS 5 Marks to T Score - submit 3 peer evaluations.\" - \"[TDS Jan 25] GA 7 Peer allocations - submit 3 peer evaluations.\" - Each email entry features a paperclip icon indicating attachments. - Specific attachments include multiple HTML files with unique identifiers (e.g., `23f3003944.html`, `23f3001178.html`). - **Dates and Times**: \n  - The emails are dated with some references at 5:25 PM and April 1st. - **Background**: The Gmail interface has a simplistic design, featuring a navigation panel on the left. ``` Hi Shambhavi, Thanks for the update. We will look into it. Thanks once again Sir,  \nIn case we are not provided access to view their respective sheets, we would have no option but to either leave the column blank or mark it as 0. However, if others have marked it differently based on their available information, there is a possibility that our responses may vary — potentially exceeding the permissible variance limit of ±33%. In such a scenario, would this mean we would not be eligible for the bonus? Additionally, it would be really helpful if a uniform approach or standard marking could be communicated for such cases where access is not granted. This would ensure consistency across all submissions and avoid discrepancies arising from random or subjective entries, which seems to be happening currently. If you are not provided access, contact the peer. Their email is there in the html file. It’s in the peers interest **and** yours. That’s an important aspect of GA7, it’s to get people to work together and collaborate. Peer reviews like the real world is going to be messy. The way to reduce the messiness is to communicate with one another. [@carlton](/u/carlton)  \nsir can you please clarify what do we have to write in google form if there is no submission? You have two options. Get in touch with the peer (you have their email address), this is the recommended approach. Or you could give them zero because you were not able to evaluate their submission."
