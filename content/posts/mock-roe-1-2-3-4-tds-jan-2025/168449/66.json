Some tasks require downloading libraries, whereas you may already have these libraries or other necessary setups in place, which naturally reduces your solving time.</p>\n<p>As you are aware, additional time will only benefit those who have prepared and possess the required knowledge. Students without preparation will not gain any advantage simply due to an extension. Furthermore, as the course has been modified from the previous term and many aspects are still being refined, we have already requested measures to support our performance and ensure our grades are not put at undue risk.</p>\n<p>I genuinely prioritize knowledge over marks and have put in significant effort to excel in this course. However, I do not want to risk failing. My goal is simply to meet  the passing criteria (at least 40 marks) . Therefore, I sincerely request you to consider granting additional time for the ROE as a reasonable relief.</p>\n<p>Your understanding and support in this matter would be greatly appreciated.<br>\nBest Regards,<br>\nLakshay</p>", "post_number": 66, "post_type": 1, "posts_count": 80, "updated_at": "2025-02-28T05:48:01.028Z", "reply_count": 4, "reply_to_post_number": null, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 76, "reads": 159, "readers_count": 158, "score": 761.6, "yours": false, "topic_id": 168449, "topic_slug": "mock-roe-1-2-3-4-tds-jan-2025", "display_username": "LAKSHAY", "primary_group_name": "ds-students", "flair_name": "ds-students", "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": "", "flair_color": "", "flair_group_id": 294, "badges_granted": [], "version": 1, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_see_hidden_post": false, "can_wiki": false, "link_counts": [{"url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/remote-online-exam-tds-jan-2025/168832/14", "internal": true, "reflection": true, "title": "Remote Online Exam [TDS Jan 2025]", "clicks": 0}], "read": true, "user_title": null, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [{"id": 2, "count": 22, "can_act": true}, {"id": 6, "can_act": true}, {"id": 3, "can_act": true}, {"id": 4, "can_act": true}, {"id": 8, "can_act": true}, {"id": 10, "can_act": true}, {"id": 7, "can_act": true}], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 7193, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 1, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "post_url": "/t/mock-roe-1-2-3-4-tds-jan-2025/168449/66", "user_cakedate": "2021-09-12", "reactions": [{"id": "heart", "type": "emoji", "count": 22}], "current_user_reaction": null, "reaction_users_count": 22, "current_user_used_main_reaction": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false, "topic_accepted_answer": null}
