I struggle with it a lot too when discussing it with Anand. Is there value or learning, in blind copying. Im not so sure. At some point someone has to learn to become an expert. A critical thinker. There is even a Microsoft study now that shows that GPT usage impacts critical thinking. Are we going to end up with a generation of people who can no longer critically think to solve a problem? These are good philosophical questions. I lie somewhere more on the conservative side of that spectrum. But everyone has to grapple with this tradeoff. Where does the right balance lie? I don\u2019t know the answer to that question for others. I know the right answer for me.</p>\n<p>Kind regards</p>", "post_number": 45, "post_type": 1, "posts_count": 80, "updated_at": "2025-02-26T17:14:15.673Z", "reply_count": 1, "reply_to_post_number": 44, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 0, "reads": 93, "readers_count": 92, "score": 53.4, "yours": false, "topic_id": 168449, "topic_slug": "mock-roe-1-2-3-4-tds-jan-2025", "display_username": "Carlton D'Silva", "primary_group_name": "ds-students", "flair_name": "ds-students", "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": "", "flair_color": "", "flair_group_id": 294, "badges_granted": [], "version": 1, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_see_hidden_post": false, "can_wiki": false, "read": true, "user_title": "Regular", "title_is_group": false, "reply_to_user": {"id": 36619, "username": "trebhuvansb", "name": "Trebhuvan SB", "avatar_template": "/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/trebhuvansb/{size}/109875_2.png"}, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [{"id": 2, "count": 2, "can_act": true}, {"id": 6, "can_act": true}, {"id": 3, "can_act": true}, {"id": 4, "can_act": true}, {"id": 8, "can_act": true}, {"id": 10, "can_act": true}, {"id": 7, "can_act": true}], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "group_moderator": true, "user_id": 16094, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 3, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "post_url": "/t/mock-roe-1-2-3-4-tds-jan-2025/168449/45", "user_cakedate": "2023-01-25", "reactions": [{"id": "heart", "type": "emoji", "count": 2}], "current_user_reaction": null, "reaction_users_count": 2, "current_user_used_main_reaction": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false, "topic_accepted_answer": null}
