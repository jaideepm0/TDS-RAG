I feel less complex (but still questions that test your critical thinking) and proctored ROE (with access to documentation of the different services used) could help. In this way people can use gpt models to crack the difficult GA questions but through ROE you can actually still test their knowledge on the topics which are covered.

But this too has its caveats, there doesnâ€™t seem to be a proper solution to this ![:sweat_smile:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/sweat_smile.png?v=12 ":sweat_smile:")
