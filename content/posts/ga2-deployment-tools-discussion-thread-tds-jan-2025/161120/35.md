Hi Aindree,

I tried to send a request to your application `https://your-app2.vercel.app/api` with url encoded parameter `class=7Q`. It should fetch marks of that particular class. But in response it sends `{"marks": []}`.

Check if your csv file is correct. Also check if code is correct.

Kind regards  
Jivraj
