The issue might be with the IP address you’re using. Try using `127.0.0.1` and check if it’s the correct localhost IP for your machine. Also, test with `http://localhost:8000/api` to see if it works.

If that doesn’t solve the problem and you’re running port 8000 inside a virtual machine, use the `ipconfig` command to check the correct IP address.
