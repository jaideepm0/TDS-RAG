I am facing several problems with the submission portal …

1. In question no 5 I entered the answer 78918 It was correct , I submitted it after few hours when I reloaded the portal its showing incorrect … I tried to enter twice thrice also solved it again but no use…
2. In question 10 I entered the required link it was correct after saving it and reloading the portal it shows incorrect …
3. In question 9 I did all the necessary thing but the portal is showing couldn’t fetch … My system is able to fetch the data but the portal says “failed to fetch”
