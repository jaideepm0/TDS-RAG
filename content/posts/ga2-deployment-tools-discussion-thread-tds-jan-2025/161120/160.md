Hi [@24f1002359](/u/24f1002359)

For **Question 10**, ensure that **all servers are running** every time you submit (click the **Save** button). Since **ngrok generates a new URL each time it runs**, double-check that the **ngrok URL is correct** before submitting.

For **Question 9**, did you **enable CORS**? To verify, check your **browser console**—if CORS is not enabled, you should see an error message indicating the issue.

For question 5, I have tried executed script with your set of parameters, your answer is correct. Will discuss it internally.

Kind regards.
