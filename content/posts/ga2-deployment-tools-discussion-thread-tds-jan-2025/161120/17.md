I am facing an issue with Docker Desktop.

[![Docker Desktop Error](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/7/d7bcf7a2f709561b98fa8bde031ab5d1e81a4a0d.png)

I have uninstalled and installed Docker (run as administrator).

wsl --version

```
WSL version: 2.3.26.0
Kernel version: 5.15.167.4-1
WSLg version: 1.0.65
MSRDC version: 1.2.5620
Direct3D version: 1.611.1-81528511
DXCore version: 10.0.26100.1-240331-1435.ge-release
Windows version: 10.0.19045.5011

```

Tried many solutions after googling for the issue.  
So far no solution. Anyone else faced this issue and found a solution?
