This allowed the agent to dynamically generate and execute code without hardcoding anything.</li>\n<li>Adding useful API endpoints, including an <strong><code>/api/</code></strong> multipart/form endpoint, alongside the existing <strong><code>/read</code></strong> and <strong><code>/run</code></strong> endpoints from Project 1, plus a <strong><code>/clear</code></strong> endpoint to reset the agent\u2019s conversation memory if the context window gets saturated.</li>\n<li><strong>Deploying the entire project on a paid GCP VM Instance with a static IP</strong>, utilizing my own OpenAI API key while keeping OpenAI\u2019s API as a fallback in case AIPROXY ever gave up.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All this hard work evolved my project into something far beyond a simple Tool-Calling Agent\u2014it essentially became a ReAct Principles based Computer-Using Agent capable of executing complex, non-linear workflows entirely within a container. And I\u2019m not exaggerating: You could ask it to perform something like <strong>hyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest Classifier, offloading the results locally on a JSON file and displaying its contents</strong>, and it would do that for you\u2014without <strong>ever</strong> declining the request. I like to think of it as a <strong>terminal version of</strong> <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/computer-using-agent/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">OpenAI\u2019s Computer-Using Agent</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Given all the effort, time, and money that went into this, it\u2019s incredibly discouraging to see my project <strong>naturally fail a sanity check (Docker image digest mismatch) (because of the aforesaid updates)</strong> and not get evaluated as a result. This is not the kind of experience that encourages students to learn, experiment, and innovate.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-614374-to-clarify-all-the-updates-mentioned-above-took-place-after-march-29-after-project-1-had-already-been-evaluated-and-results-had-been-handed-out-furthermore-we-were-never-informed-that-a-reevaluation-would-take-place-on-april-1-had-i-known-i-would-have-ensured-that-my-original-submission-remained-unchanged-and-considered-creating-a-duplicate-of-my-docker-image-and-implementing-all-the-aforementioned-enhancements-on-it-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-614374-to-clarify-all-the-updates-mentioned-above-took-place-after-march-29-after-project-1-had-already-been-evaluated-and-results-had-been-handed-out-furthermore-we-were-never-informed-that-a-reevaluation-would-take-place-on-april-1-had-i-known-i-would-have-ensured-that-my-original-submission-remained-unchanged-and-considered-creating-a-duplicate-of-my-docker-image-and-implementing-all-the-aforementioned-enhancements-on-it-1\"></a>To clarify, <strong>all the updates mentioned above took place after March 29</strong>, <strong>after Project 1 had already been evaluated, and results had been handed out.</strong> Furthermore, we were <strong>never informed</strong> that a reevaluation would take place on April 1.
