We looked at your script and there are errors in it. It doesnâ€™t follow what we mentioned in live sessions.

Line number 81 of your app.py

`subprocess.run(["uv", "run", script_name, "--root", "./data"] + args, check=True)`

which creates a data directory inside app directory but evaluate.py expects data directory to be in root directory.
