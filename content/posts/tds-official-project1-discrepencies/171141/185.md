dear [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)

Dear Sirs,

I have seen that many others have posted similar issues to mine, and you have responded to some of them. To seek your attention, I am replying to this thread.

Please consider my request as well, as I do not want to lose marks on a project I have worked hard on, while also helping others. I am expecting a timely and positive response from your end.

Thank you.
