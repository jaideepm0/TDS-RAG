I recently received an email stating that my Docker image is not publicly available, resulting in a failed prerequisite check for the TDS Project 1. However, I have ensured that my Docker image is publicly accessible. Please help.

My Docker image ID is "**99d08f2002fa** ", and it is set to public. I kindly request you to review this issue, as I have worked very hard on this project and would appreciate the opportunity for a fair evaluation.
