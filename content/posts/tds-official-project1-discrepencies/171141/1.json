This is the list of docker repos that was given to us by <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/s.anand\">@s.anand</a> as the official list that met all the pre-requisites of Project 1. Therefore we will only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos <em>you</em> gave us.</p>\n<p>For clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No other image id will be evaluated.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-612319-how-to-fix-bugs-in-our-scripts-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-612319-how-to-fix-bugs-in-our-scripts-2\"></a>How to fix bugs in our scripts</h2>\n<p>Create Pull requests to <a href=\"https://github.com/Jivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Jivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1</a> .</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-612319-docker-image-architecture-issue-report-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-612319-docker-image-architecture-issue-report-3\"></a><strong>Docker Image Architecture Issue Report</strong></h3>\n<p>If your Docker image was run on the wrong architecture, please fill out this form:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSerCpqod-5ArJWTW_QW5PenyfZJHH_cmcUw3s8dAoG3zDZm8g/viewform?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Submit Report</a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-612319-bug-fixes-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-612319-bug-fixes-4\"></a>Bug fixes</h2>\n<p>If you find bugs in our evaluation scripts, you might benefit from more marks because of the bug fix.
