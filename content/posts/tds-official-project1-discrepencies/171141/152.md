There might be some glitches in the system. Could you kindly verify the process again?

I’ve already received my score in the evaluation log. Additionally, the Docker Hub run logs show no errors, and both the GitHub repo and Docker image are publicly accessible. All the content has been verified and meets the prerequisites.

Let me know if any further action is needed from my end.
