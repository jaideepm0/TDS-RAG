Respected Sir,

the link for evaluation in which i got 7/20 is : [23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\_evaluation.log - Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cNVy9KSfSITZg_KGLF2_wwLWjzNl8mb5/view)

So according to the above, I passed the pre-requisites and also in mail u have mentioned that:  
We have attached the docker logs and the evaluation logs for everyone who passed the pre-requisites.

but I don’t find my mail id or roll number in the docker\_logs.zip or evaluation\_logs.zip that has been given in the mail(latest), if I passed the pre requisites my logs should be there in the zip files included in this latest mail right, my roll number is 23f2001390 and email id is 23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in  
and nor do i find my id in the p1\_evaluation\_error\_logs so please help sir  
Thank you
