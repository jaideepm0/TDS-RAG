I’m facing “exec /usr/local/bin/uvicorn: exec format error” , My roll number is 21f3003062@ds.study.iitm.ac.in , My roll is in x86 list/log , not in ARM list/log. I have written and tested my code on ARM computer. I request to please check my code manually. [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton) .
