Thanks for your quick response sir. I just wanted to clarify that my dockerfile was recognized by Docker, and my image was successfully built, so it seems that Docker itself didn’t have an issue with the filename.

However, I understand that the evaluation script might be case-sensitive and specifically looking for “Dockerfile” with an uppercase “D”. If that’s the issue, should I rename and push the file again to the repo sir.

Please let me know if that’s the right fix or if I need to do anything else sir.
