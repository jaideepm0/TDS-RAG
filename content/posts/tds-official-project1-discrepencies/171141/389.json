We are losing our marks because of small negligence or mistakes like i fogot to commit my requirements.txt in my github repository. Already the course has taken tolls on our mind. Please give partial marks for the correct run of the docker image or please evaluate my latest commit with the requirements.txt. Because of this project I will lose my cgpa and the hardwork that I have done till this term. A small mistake is causing me my full marks and grades. Atleast consider partial marking for the docker image which does the tasks. I have maintained 9+ cgpa in the diploma and I took other subjects which are easy this term like BDM still is really difficult to cope with the subject. Please consider something. atleast give 50% of the marks for each task which my image passes.</p>", "post_number": 389, "post_type": 1, "posts_count": 467, "updated_at": "2025-04-07T02:07:05.575Z", "reply_count": 1, "reply_to_post_number": 366, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 1, "reads": 67, "readers_count": 66, "score": 38.2, "yours": false, "topic_id": 171141, "topic_slug": "tds-official-project1-discrepencies", "display_username": "Veer Shah", "primary_group_name": "ds-students", "flair_name": "ds-students", "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": "", "flair_color": "", "flair_group_id": 294, "badges_granted": [], "version": 3, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_see_hidden_post": false, "can_wiki": false, "read": false, "user_title": null, "reply_to_user": {"id": 15651, "username": "Jivraj", "name": "Jivraj Singh Shekhawat", "avatar_template": "https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/j/b9bd4f/{size}.png"}, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [{"id": 2, "count": 1, "can_act": true}, {"id": 6, "can_act": true}, {"id": 3, "can_act": true}, {"id": 4, "can_act": true}, {"id": 8, "can_act": true}, {"id": 10, "can_act": true}, {"id": 7, "can_act": true}], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 21011, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 1, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "post_url": "/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/389", "user_cakedate": "2023-06-18", "reactions": [{"id": "heart", "type": "emoji", "count": 1}], "current_user_reaction": null, "reaction_users_count": 1, "current_user_used_main_reaction": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false, "topic_accepted_answer": null}
