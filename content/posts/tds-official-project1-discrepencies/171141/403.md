Sir, I sincerely apologize for the mistake I made in naming the LICENSE file as “LIcense” instead of “LICENSE”. I now understand how important these details are, and it was an unintentional oversight on my part. I had put in a lot of hard work into the project, and it would mean a lot to me if you could kindly consider evaluating it, even though the deadline has passed and results are out. I completely understand if it’s not possible, but I just wanted to request a chance as this project was very important to me and I genuinely learned a lot from it.
