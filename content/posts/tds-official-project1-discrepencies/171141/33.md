Hi @all

We will identify why arm images created a problem and were run using x86 platform.

We will also rerun evaluations for all the x86 and arm images one more time, before pushing to the dashboard.

> Hi [@jivraj](/u/jivraj),

[@23f3003302](/u/23f3003302) output from your server’s response is correct, we will update our evaluation script.

[@23f2004912](/u/23f2004912) We will discuss internally if we can do something about it, but I can’t assure if you will get marks for it, since output from your server is a bit different.

[@HarshJaiswal](/u/harshjaiswal) I looked for your response for project1 docker image, and found out that we used correct image id. Here is repo information `harshjaiswal1/tds_project_final latest d0f14a872042 5 weeks ago 214MB`

> The 2 other log files i’m given doesnt have my email inside it listed.

We are aware about it results for 12 students are not generated, we will look into it, and see what caused those 12 images not to run.

> My evaluation log file is missing in report provided. It says tasksA was not found. but I have submitted tasksA in my project file. Also it says server didnt start for 5 mins but for me image was working fine. please kindly help me out. I have made submissions correctly.

It would have run at your end but it was supposed to run at anywhere, after dockerising it didn’t run, reason is taskA module was not found.
