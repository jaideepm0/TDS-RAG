However, I felt it was important to express how much effort and dedication I have invested in this project and throughout the course. The recent issue has been disheartening for me, especially because the work I submitted was not a blind copy from someone else.</p>\n<p>Had it been otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t have had the courage to reach out. I genuinely care about this course and the learning it offers, and I\u2019m proud of the commitment I\u2019ve shown so far.</p>\n<p>With utmost respect, I kindly request you to reconsider evaluating my project again, if there\u2019s any possible way to do so. It would mean a lot to me and would really motivate me to keep pushing forward in this subject.</p>", "post_number": 392, "post_type": 1, "posts_count": 467, "updated_at": "2025-04-07T04:25:33.067Z", "reply_count": 0, "reply_to_post_number": 383, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 0, "reads": 64, "readers_count": 63, "score": 12.6, "yours": false, "topic_id": 171141, "topic_slug": "tds-official-project1-discrepencies", "display_username": "Afsal", "primary_group_name": "ds-students", "flair_name": "ds-students", "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": "", "flair_color": "", "flair_group_id": 294, "badges_granted": [], "version": 1, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_see_hidden_post": false, "can_wiki": false, "read": false, "user_title": null, "reply_to_user": {"id": 15651, "username": "Jivraj", "name": "Jivraj Singh Shekhawat", "avatar_template": "https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/j/b9bd4f/{size}.png"}, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [{"id": 2, "can_act": true}, {"id": 6, "can_act": true}, {"id": 3, "can_act": true}, {"id": 4, "can_act": true}, {"id": 8, "can_act": true}, {"id": 10, "can_act": true}, {"id": 7, "can_act": true}], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 7597, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 1, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "post_url": "/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/392", "user_cakedate": "2021-09-29", "reactions": [], "current_user_reaction": null, "reaction_users_count": 0, "current_user_used_main_reaction": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false, "topic_accepted_answer": null}
