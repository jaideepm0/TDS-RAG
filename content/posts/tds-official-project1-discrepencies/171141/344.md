Dear Sir,  
I got log with error as /bin/sh: 1: [/root/.local/bin/uv,: not found.  
I debugged that I had a small issue in the dockerfile that was submitted and it is  
CMD [“/root/.local/bin/uv”, “run”, “app.py”] has an **invisible Unicode non-breaking space** (`U+00A0`) between `"run", "app.py"` instead of a regular space. This causes the shell to misread the command.  
I know it’s very late for the submission to reconsider, but this small mistake spoiled my hard earned project which got local score 8/25 which could finally get converted to 12 marks. I made this change and pushed it to docker and github repository. Considering this, I request you to please evaluate my submission if possible, because I don’t want to lose the marks which i tried my level best to score. I already have good score in GA’s and ROE. Expecting a positive response from your end.
