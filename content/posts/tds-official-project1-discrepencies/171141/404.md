got consistent 6/25 after even running the file 6 times [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) Please sir check this, just because my docker image needs .env, I cannot get full 0…I need to maintain my cgpa (by getting 0 in project my grade is going too close to E grade sir and already in D, already my ROE got bad due to technical issues which on the same day around 6pm after finding way to unlock the input of answers for roe I completed the roe again in short amount of time like 10 or 20 minutes and got 10/10 but still it was rejected because it was late, max 3 minutes after 1:45PM was allowed…I’m not asking to any extra marks, just my marks) I’m trying to improve it already I have 4 subjects in a single term, please give me atleast this marks with the bonus 1 mark for prerequisites (total 7)
