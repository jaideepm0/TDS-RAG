Sir,  
In the mail that i got about project 1 report. In the log file it was written as TasksA.py file not found in docker, which was the case i observed with many students.

I built the image using docker build command in vs code terminal. And pushed it same way to dockerhub using docker push command. How is it possible that the docker container missed the TasksA.py file while building or pushing it?

After getting this mail, I ran the project locally again mutliple times just to check if there was any issues in the code. It was getting 9/10 test cases passed.
