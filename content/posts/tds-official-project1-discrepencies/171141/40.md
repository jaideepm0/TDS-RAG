I noticed that my Docker image was run on an x86\_64 architecture (as indicated by my email in the shared logs), whereas I originally built it on my Mac (ARM architecture). Due to this mismatch, the image failed to run properly and resulted in an exec format error.

Since there was no prior mention of the architecture on which our images would be evaluated, I request that my evaluation be conducted again on the appropriate machine. Please help as after doing it correctly getting 0 marks because of such an error feels wrong
