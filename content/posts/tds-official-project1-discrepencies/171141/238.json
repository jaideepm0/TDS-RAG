I fully understand the importance of marks and the effort we put into Project 1. That\u2019s why I carefully ensured that all the necessary files and links were correctly uploaded yet I received a 0 Score.</p>\n<p>I am not the only one facing this issue; several others have encountered the same problem. I kindly request you to review my submission again.</p>\n<p>Additionally, I have faced multiple technical issues in recent times. Initially, I was failed in the L1 viva due to a typing mistake, which was later acknowledged. Similarly, in both OPPE 1 and OPPE 2, many students experienced Google Meet issues. On March 29, during my SC OPPE, I faced camera issues in Google Meet, along with VM lagging. Many students have raised similar concerns with Proctor.</p>\n<p>Given this track record of technical problems, I strongly believe this could be another error in evaluation. I sincerely request you to re-evaluate my submission.</p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/c/1/c15a5d064b9f2bc82a892ef7da1228f031feb29b.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/rAtKM461XD9XoJ6jwMBzL4HpfnB.png?dl=1\" title=\"Screenshot 2025-04-01 020618\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/c/1/c15a5d064b9f2bc82a892ef7da1228f031feb29b_2_690x344.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-04-01 020618\" data-base62-sha1=\"rAtKM461XD9XoJ6jwMBzL4HpfnB\" width=\"690\" height=\"344\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/c/1/c15a5d064b9f2bc82a892ef7da1228f031feb29b_2_690x344.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/c/1/c15a5d064b9f2bc82a892ef7da1228f031feb29b_2_1035x516.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/c/1/c15a5d064b9f2bc82a892ef7da1228f031feb29b.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F6F6F7\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">Screenshot 2025-04-01 020618</span><span class=\"informations\">1335\u00d7667 57.9 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>", "post_number": 238, "post_type": 1, "posts_count": 467, "updated_at": "2025-04-03T07:02:38.290Z", "reply_count": 1, "reply_to_post_number": null, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 0, "reads": 34, "readers_count": 33, "score": 11.4, "yours": false, "topic_id": 171141, "topic_slug": "tds-official-project1-discrepencies", "display_username": "Saini Nirmal", "primary_group_name": "ds-students", "flair_name": "ds-students", "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": "", "flair_color": "", "flair_group_id": 294, "badges_granted": [], "version": 1, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_see_hidden_post": false, "can_wiki": false, "read": false, "user_title": null, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [{"id": 2, "can_act": true}, {"id": 6, "can_act": true}, {"id": 3, "can_act": true}, {"id": 4, "can_act": true}, {"id": 8, "can_act": true}, {"id": 10, "can_act": true}, {"id": 7, "can_act": true}], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 17649, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 1, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "post_url": "/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/238", "user_cakedate": "2023-06-03", "reactions": [{"id": "heart", "type": "emoji", "count": 10}], "current_user_reaction": null, "reaction_users_count": 10, "current_user_used_main_reaction": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false, "topic_accepted_answer": null}
