I now understand how important these details are, and it was an unintentional oversight on my part. I had put in a lot of hard work into the project, and it would mean a lot to me if you could kindly consider evaluating it, even though the deadline has passed and results are out. I completely understand if it\u2019s not possible, but I just wanted to request a chance as this project was very important to me and I genuinely learned a lot from it.<br>\n<a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/jivraj\">@Jivraj</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/carlton\">@carlton</a></p>", "post_number": 403, "post_type": 1, "posts_count": 467, "updated_at": "2025-04-07T09:57:43.886Z", "reply_count": 2, "reply_to_post_number": 368, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 0, "reads": 60, "readers_count": 59, "score": 36.8, "yours": false, "topic_id": 171141, "topic_slug": "tds-official-project1-discrepencies", "display_username": " KARTHIK", "primary_group_name": "ds-students", "flair_name": "ds-students", "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": "", "flair_color": "", "flair_group_id": 294, "badges_granted": [], "version": 1, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_see_hidden_post": false, "can_wiki": false, "read": false, "user_title": null, "reply_to_user": {"id": 15651, "username": "Jivraj", "name": "Jivraj Singh Shekhawat", "avatar_template": "https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/j/b9bd4f/{size}.png"}, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [{"id": 2, "count": 1, "can_act": true}, {"id": 6, "can_act": true}, {"id": 3, "can_act": true}, {"id": 4, "can_act": true}, {"id": 8, "can_act": true}, {"id": 10, "can_act": true}, {"id": 7, "can_act": true}], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 25776, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 1, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "post_url": "/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/403", "user_cakedate": "2024-01-29", "reactions": [{"id": "heart", "type": "emoji", "count": 1}], "current_user_reaction": null, "reaction_users_count": 1, "current_user_used_main_reaction": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false, "topic_accepted_answer": null}
