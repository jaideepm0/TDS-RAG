[@carlton](/u/carlton) same issue, My image was also run on a `x86_64` architecture. I too built on my mac which is `ARM` (M1 Processor). I too can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the `exec format error` and **Evaluation log file** is MISSING.

Actually my image was run on x86\_64 architecture as it was present in that log file and because of the wrong architecture it never started.

I also request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.
