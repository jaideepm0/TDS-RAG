These versions worked perfectly during development on my local machine and were tested multiple times across both Linux and Windows platforms before submission.

This was the only change made to my submission. After rebuilding the container with this updated file, I tested it again thoroughly in your replicated test environment, and it worked as expected:</p>\n<p>The application initializes correctly on port 8000 within 5 minutes.</p>\n<p>It responds to requests within the required timeframe.</p>\n<p>I have pushed this updated image to Docker Hub under the same repository:<br>\nDocker Hub URL: santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest</p>\n<p>Request for Re-Evaluation<br>\nI kindly request that you pull the latest version of my Docker image from Docker Hub and re-run the evaluation process. I understand that deployability is being tested, and I have taken every necessary step to ensure that my submission now works in any environment, including replicating your test setup exactly.</p>\n<p>Previous Message for Reference<br>\nFor your convenience, here is my earlier message explaining this issue in detail:</p>\n<p>\"Greetings, Sir,</p>\n<p>I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.</p>\n<p>To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your assistance!\"</p>", "post_number": 350, "post_type": 1, "posts_count": 467, "updated_at": "2025-04-06T15:16:52.371Z", "reply_count": 1, "reply_to_post_number": 318, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 2, "reads": 87, "readers_count": 86, "score": 32.2, "yours": false, "topic_id": 171141, "topic_slug": "tds-official-project1-discrepencies", "display_username": "Santosh Sharma", "primary_group_name": "ds-students", "flair_name": "ds-students", "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": "", "flair_color": "", "flair_group_id": 294, "badges_granted": [], "version": 1, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_see_hidden_post": false, "can_wiki": false, "read": false, "user_title": null, "reply_to_user": {"id": 16094, "username": "carlton", "name": "Carlton D'Silva", "avatar_template": "/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/carlton/{size}/56317_2.png"}, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [{"id": 2, "can_act": true}, {"id": 6, "can_act": true}, {"id": 3, "can_act": true}, {"id": 4, "can_act": true}, {"id": 8, "can_act": true}, {"id": 10, "can_act": true}, {"id": 7, "can_act": true}], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 29451, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 1, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "post_url": "/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/350", "user_cakedate": "2024-02-29", "reactions": [], "current_user_reaction": null, "reaction_users_count": 0, "current_user_used_main_reaction": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false, "topic_accepted_answer": null}
