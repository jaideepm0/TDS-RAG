Thanks [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
As mentioned earlier, the pre Feb 18 dockerFile commited in GIT had my office proxy url’s set as http\_proxy and https\_proxy.. It worked in my office envuironment and i tested everything in my office environment but based on the results which came on March last week realised that the proxies were preventing the uv to be installed in other environments.

Post that realised we have cloud based "docker playground’ utility where docker builds can be tested agonistic of any environment.. The good thing with playground is our instances last for only 3 hrs and next day we try we are kind of gauranteed of fresh environment without any caches,

Now after March 30th checkin validated the same in docker playground and ensured that the image got tagged and createdd successfully..

It would be great if the March 30th checkin could be considered, Again appreciate all your help so far.
