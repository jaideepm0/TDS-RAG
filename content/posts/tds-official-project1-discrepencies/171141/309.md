Dear [@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir,  
I’ve noticed discrepancies in my Project 1 results. During the tests I ran before submitting, I consistently got about 7/10 in Task A. In the results shared earlier, I was informed that my evaluation log file was missing. Later, a Gform regarding the architecture was sent, which I filled and submitted. Now, the final result I received today, shows that the taskA module is missing and I’ve been given a bonus of 1 mark.  
I kindly request you to look into the matter and provide an explanation and solution in this regard.  
Thank you.
