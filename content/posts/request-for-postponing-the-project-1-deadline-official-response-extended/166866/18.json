Here are the highlights of the discussion:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday.</li>\n<li>All the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago)</li>\n<li>Project 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago)</li>\n<li>We had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students:</p>\n<p><strong>Project 1 deadline will NOT be changed.</strong></p>\n<p>Please make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements.</p>\n<p>Kind regards<br>\nTDS Team</p>", "post_number": 18, "post_type": 1, "posts_count": 27, "updated_at": "2025-02-14T06:44:21.075Z", "reply_count": 3, "reply_to_post_number": null, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 2, "reads": 114, "readers_count": 113, "score": 47.2, "yours": false, "topic_id": 166866, "topic_slug": "request-for-postponing-the-project-1-deadline-official-response-extended", "display_username": "Carlton D'Silva", "primary_group_name": "ds-students", "flair_name": "ds-students", "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": "", "flair_color": "", "flair_group_id": 294, "badges_granted": [], "version": 1, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_see_hidden_post": false, "can_wiki": false, "read": false, "user_title": "Regular", "title_is_group": false, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [{"id": 2, "can_act": true}, {"id": 6, "can_act": true}, {"id": 3, "can_act": true}, {"id": 4, "can_act": true}, {"id": 8, "can_act": true}, {"id": 10, "can_act": true}, {"id": 7, "can_act": true}], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "group_moderator": true, "user_id": 16094, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 3, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "post_url": "/t/request-for-postponing-the-project-1-deadline-official-response-extended/166866/18", "user_cakedate": "2023-01-25", "reactions": [], "current_user_reaction": null, "reaction_users_count": 0, "current_user_used_main_reaction": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false, "topic_accepted_answer": null}
