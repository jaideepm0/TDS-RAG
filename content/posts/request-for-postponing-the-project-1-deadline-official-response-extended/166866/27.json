As many students are finding it challenging to achieve high score in Project 1 and have been requesting an extension for the deadline. Instead of extending the deadline, I propose adjusting the weightage, allocating 15% to Project 1 and 25% to Project 2.<br>\nThis adjustment seems fair, as Project 2 requires students to build upon the concepts used in Project 1. By making this change, it would provide additional time for improvement and potentially help those who struggled with the first project to to get good scores, without disadvantaging those who performed well initially.<br>\nWould it be possible to implement this change?</p>", "post_number": 27, "post_type": 1, "posts_count": 27, "updated_at": "2025-02-15T16:22:43.476Z", "reply_count": 0, "reply_to_post_number": 18, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 0, "reads": 58, "readers_count": 57, "score": 25.8, "yours": false, "topic_id": 166866, "topic_slug": "request-for-postponing-the-project-1-deadline-official-response-extended", "display_username": "Aman Kumar Sinha", "primary_group_name": "ds-students", "flair_name": "ds-students", "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": "", "flair_color": "", "flair_group_id": 294, "badges_granted": [], "version": 1, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_see_hidden_post": false, "can_wiki": false, "read": false, "user_title": "", "reply_to_user": {"id": 16094, "username": "carlton", "name": "Carlton D'Silva", "avatar_template": "/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/carlton/{size}/56317_2.png"}, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [{"id": 2, "count": 1, "can_act": true}, {"id": 6, "can_act": true}, {"id": 3, "can_act": true}, {"id": 4, "can_act": true}, {"id": 8, "can_act": true}, {"id": 10, "can_act": true}, {"id": 7, "can_act": true}], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 16194, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 1, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "post_url": "/t/request-for-postponing-the-project-1-deadline-official-response-extended/166866/27", "user_cakedate": "2023-01-25", "reactions": [{"id": "heart", "type": "emoji", "count": 1}], "current_user_reaction": null, "reaction_users_count": 1, "current_user_used_main_reaction": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false, "topic_accepted_answer": null}
