For example, the GitHub link of the datagen.py was incorrect and I was confused due to the code not generating the expected outcome.</p>\n<p>The LLM was giving creative answers which did not follow the strict evaluation guidelines. So, the case was not passed. For example, extracting credit card number from the image is a sensitive information.</p>\n<p>I am alright with it since the evaluation will be different.</p>\n<p>Now, I am really well versed with the tools taught in these weeks. Thanking the whole TDS Team for this project which was very well designed. <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/grinning.png?v=12\" title=\":grinning:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":grinning:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>", "post_number": 13, "post_type": 1, "posts_count": 13, "updated_at": "2025-02-19T11:00:09.228Z", "reply_count": 0, "reply_to_post_number": null, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 0, "reads": 158, "readers_count": 157, "score": 76.0, "yours": false, "topic_id": 167344, "topic_slug": "project-1-casual-banter", "display_username": "Naman S.
