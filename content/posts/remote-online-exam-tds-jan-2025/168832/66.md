Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) / [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)

I am Gudivada Abiram(21f3002158). In my todayâ€™s ROE exam I forgot to click the save button. My score initially was 6/10. I was tackling another question and by that time the timer went off. I can even send my answers if required.  
I should have submitted more frequently, but I was busy solving the other questions for extra marks.  
Could you please consider my request?  
Thank you.
