Hello Sir"s, [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)

I was able to successfully attempt only 5 questions within the time limit. But due to internet issues, I could not submit exactly at 1:45pm.  
My last submission was at 1:47pm. But if there was a auto save then you could already check my answers were in the portal.

I request you to please consider submission delays of 2-3 mins as this was due a technical glitches. And we too are switching tabs and running in vscode

Kind Regards,  
Muthu
