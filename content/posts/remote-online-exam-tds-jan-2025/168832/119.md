Dont worry, we have the right scores on our server. There has been some problem in sending the export to the operations team. Your scores are safe. We are working on figuring out the problem. Even the bonus marks are recorded. Just give us a couple of days to sort it out. Many students have been affected so we cant give individual responses right now. Its a system fix that needs to be implemented.
