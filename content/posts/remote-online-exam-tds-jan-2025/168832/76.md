[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir, I got disconnected at around 1:35 due to a network glitch and had to restart my uv server as well collab which wasted around 5 min and my score was around 7 and further I ran multiple scripts which I had already saved as code snippets as part of GA for question 4 on vs code and Collab and finally got the answer but I exceeded the time limit since the submission I made was at 1:47:28 which was 9…so I request to please consider that  
Overall the ROE was a great experience and I wholly enjoyed the process

Thank you for giving us this amazing opportunity
