[@23f2005067](/u/23f2005067) [@23f2003751](/u/23f2003751) I added a “Recent saves” feature.

This will show the time and score for the last 3 times you saved. You can load from any of these.

Do remember to click the “Check” button to calculate your score. That is not automatic.

Please check this out and let me know if there are any bugs. Thanks.
