The seek portal question is to confirm that the student has seen the GA. It does not actually give you a score. Otherwise students sometimes claim that they looked and did not find any GAs (this has happened in the past). Hence the two stage verification. You still need to ![Screenshot 2025-01-13 at 12.50.02](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/6/d67654c30e9fe72ff5970775fa393eaec8204779.png) the submissions to get a score for the GA.

The actual GA questions are on <https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/> via the seek portal or  
on the [Tools in Data Science](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/) introduction page.

Its just a more robust way of ensuring that students have indeed viewed the GAs.

As far your submission goes, we have your last submission and the score. ![:white_check_mark:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=12 ":white_check_mark:")

We will check on our end why your submission has not reloaded into your browser.  
Normally these are stored in session storage. So if your browser has deleted them, it might have not loaded from our back end server. [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) will be able to confirm the reason for this problem.

**For the time being if you are making a fresh submission, just fill in all the answers in again, so that your latest submission will be marked correctly.**

Kind regards
