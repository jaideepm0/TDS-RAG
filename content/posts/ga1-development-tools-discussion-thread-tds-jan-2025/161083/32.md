I am stuck with the last question. SQLite question.  
It gives the error:

```
Error: Got [[121510.39]]...


```

Is it possible to have a more descriptive error? It’s a simple SQL query. I tried various options in my query. I didn’t succeed. ![:thinking:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/thinking.png?v=12 ":thinking:")
