This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-599787-course-structuring-scheduling-issues-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-599787-course-structuring-scheduling-issues-2\"></a><strong>Course Structuring &amp; Scheduling Issues</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Many students pursuing this course are <strong>dual-degree students or working professionals</strong>, making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines.</li>\n<li>The <strong>last-minute guidance</strong> for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments.</li>\n<li>The <strong>structuring and scheduling of sessions</strong> feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-599787-request-for-improvement-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-599787-request-for-improvement-3\"></a><strong>Request for Improvement</strong></h3>\n<p>To ensure a smoother learning experience, I request:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2</strong>, well in advance of the deadline.</li>\n<li><strong>More structured and accessible support</strong>, considering the diverse student base, including working professionals.</li>\n<li><strong>Better management of exam difficulty levels</strong>, ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made.
