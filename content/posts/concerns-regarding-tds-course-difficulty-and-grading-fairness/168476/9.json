This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response.</p>\n<p>Let me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the <strong>grading pattern will not be changed</strong>.  And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>TDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this <a href=\"https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/diploma-course-feedback-t32024-and-course-selection-t12025-thread/160032/84\">Discourse thread</a> where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the <a href=\"https://tds.s-anand.net/#/\">first page of the TDS course</a> GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>This course is quite hard</strong></p>\n<p>Here\u2019s students\u2019 feedback:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It <em>used</em> to be an easy course until 2024. <a href=\"https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/difficulty-rating-for-diploma-subjects-based-on-students-opinion/61194\">#</a> <a href=\"https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/difficulty-rating-for-diploma-subjects-2-0-based-on-student-ratings-and-my-experience/85681\">#</a> <a href=\"https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/what-should-i-take-next/44291/6\">#</a></li>\n<li>Now it\u2019s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. <a href=\"https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/diploma-course-feedback-t32024-and-course-selection-t12025-thread/160032/45\">#</a> <a href=\"https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/2024-t1-diploma-level-feedback-and-course-selection-for-may-2024-term/127856/60\">#</a> <a href=\"https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/2024-t2-diploma-level-feedback-and-course-selection-for-september-2024-term/144976/62\">#</a></li>\n<li>Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. <a href=\"https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-unfair-grading-practices-for-tds-project-2/160611/11\">#</a> <a href=\"https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/diploma-level-course-combo-suggestion/158460/4\">#</a> <a href=\"https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/diploma-level-course-combo-suggestion/158460/7\">#</a></li>\n<li>LLMs grade you \u2013 unpredictably. <a href=\"https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-unfair-grading-practices-for-tds-project-2/160611/10\">#</a> <a href=\"https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/wrong-marks-in-project-2/160355/9\">#</a></li>\n<li>The ROE is hard. <a href=\"https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/is-it-fair-to-consider-20-weightage-of-such-exam-which-is-impossible-to-solve-in-given-time-i-e-roe/141413/10\">#</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga1\">Take Graded assignment 1</a> to check if you\u2019re ready for this course.</strong> Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It\u2019ll be too tough for you now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>TDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - <em>Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help</em><br>\nAgain to quote Anand:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>We encourage learning by sharing</strong></p>\n<p>You <em>CAN</em> copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).</p>\n<p><strong>Why should you copy?</strong> Because in real life, there\u2019s no time to re-invent the wheel. You\u2019ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It\u2019s important to learn how to do that well.</p>\n<p><strong>To learn well, understand</strong> what you\u2019re copying. If you\u2019re short of time, prioritize.</p>\n<p><strong>To learn better, teach</strong> what you\u2019ve learnt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself).<br>\nOnce again Anand has a <a href=\"https://www.s-anand.net/blog/should-courses-be-hard-or-easy/\">nice blog</a> where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable  and internally make us more humble.</li>\n<li>Whether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here.</li>\n<li>Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - <em>Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just \u201ctools\u201d, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them</em> The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them.</li>\n<li><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/22f2001640\">@22f2001640</a> Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn\u2019t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity.</li>\n</ol>", "post_number": 9, "post_type": 1, "posts_count": 17, "updated_at": "2025-02-25T18:34:40.325Z", "reply_count": 4, "reply_to_post_number": null, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 26, "reads": 202, "readers_count": 201, "score": 289.8, "yours": false, "topic_id": 168476, "topic_slug": "concerns-regarding-tds-course-difficulty-and-grading-fairness", "display_username": "Jayakrishnan", "primary_group_name": "ds-students", "flair_name": "course_support", "flair_url": "scale-balanced", "flair_bg_color": "0040ff", "flair_color": "1affc6", "flair_group_id": 41, "badges_granted": [], "version": 1, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_see_hidden_post": false, "can_wiki": false, "link_counts": [{"url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/diploma-course-feedback-t32024-and-course-selection-t12025-thread/160032/84", "internal": true, "reflection": false, "title": "Diploma Course Feedback (T32024) and Course Selection (T12025) Thread", "clicks": 9}, {"url": "https://www.s-anand.net/blog/should-courses-be-hard-or-easy/", "internal": false, "reflection": false, "title": "Should courses be hard or easy?
