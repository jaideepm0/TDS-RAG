### [Quiz from PDF](https://gkmfrombs.github.io/tds_quiz/)

That has 350 questions if you don’t want to go through all of them(it’s pretty time consuming)  
in that case just do this PDF.(This pdf contains all the questions that is a bit conceptual i would say and some questions which i failed to do ![:smiling_face_with_tear:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/smiling_face_with_tear.png?v=14 ":smiling_face_with_tear:") )
