But we will solve it in real time during the session. Thats why we are releasing it 1 hour before. We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later.</p>\n<p>ROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma.</p>\n<p>Solving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities.<br>\nThe truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time.<br>\n<em>The problem is the lack of time.</em></p>\n<p>So if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand.</p>\n<p>Additionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next.</p>\n<p>Thats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE.</p>\n<p>The real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before.<br>\nBut we will help you be as ready as possible for it.</p>\n<p>Kind regards</p>", "post_number": 3, "post_type": 1, "posts_count": 11, "updated_at": "2025-02-25T05:53:52.760Z", "reply_count": 1, "reply_to_post_number": null, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 1, "reads": 103, "readers_count": 102, "score": 30.2, "yours": false, "topic_id": 168384, "topic_slug": "clarification-regarding-mock-roe-timings", "display_username": "Carlton D'Silva", "primary_group_name": "ds-students", "flair_name": "ds-students", "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": "", "flair_color": "", "flair_group_id": 294, "badges_granted": [], "version": 1, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_see_hidden_post": false, "can_wiki": false, "read": false, "user_title": "Regular", "title_is_group": false, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [{"id": 2, "can_act": true}, {"id": 6, "can_act": true}, {"id": 3, "can_act": true}, {"id": 4, "can_act": true}, {"id": 8, "can_act": true}, {"id": 10, "can_act": true}, {"id": 7, "can_act": true}], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "group_moderator": true, "user_id": 16094, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 3, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "post_url": "/t/clarification-regarding-mock-roe-timings/168384/3", "user_cakedate": "2023-01-25", "reactions": [], "current_user_reaction": null, "reaction_users_count": 0, "current_user_used_main_reaction": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false, "topic_accepted_answer": null}
