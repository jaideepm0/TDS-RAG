We appreciate the efforts of the entire team in ensuring a smooth transition and improving the course experience.</p>\n<p>The reason for raising this separate post is that multiple doubts related to the course have been left unanswered over the past few days. Even if the course team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help us understand the ongoing process and what to expect next.</p>\n<p>We will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1 results. Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the maximum marks is 100.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, we would like to know if a session can be arranged to discuss the solution for Project 1. This would be beneficial for us in working on Project 2. Additionally, any updates regarding the pending queries for Project 2 would be greatly appreciated.<br>\nLooking forward to your response.</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nLakshay</p>", "post_number": 5, "post_type": 1, "posts_count": 5, "updated_at": "2025-03-17T12:43:30.265Z", "reply_count": 0, "reply_to_post_number": 3, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 2, "reads": 76, "readers_count": 75, "score": 24.8, "yours": false, "topic_id": 170147, "topic_slug": "concerns-regarding-various-issues-graded-assignments-project-doubts-and-roe-score-updates", "display_username": "LAKSHAY", "primary_group_name": "ds-students", "flair_name": "ds-students", "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": "", "flair_color": "", "flair_group_id": 294, "badges_granted": [], "version": 1, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_see_hidden_post": false, "can_wiki": false, "read": false, "user_title": null, "reply_to_user": {"id": 16094, "username": "carlton", "name": "Carlton D'Silva", "avatar_template": "/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/carlton/{size}/56317_2.png"}, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [{"id": 2, "can_act": true}, {"id": 6, "can_act": true}, {"id": 3, "can_act": true}, {"id": 4, "can_act": true}, {"id": 8, "can_act": true}, {"id": 10, "can_act": true}, {"id": 7, "can_act": true}], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 7193, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 1, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "post_url": "/t/concerns-regarding-various-issues-graded-assignments-project-doubts-and-roe-score-updates/170147/5", "user_cakedate": "2021-09-12", "reactions": [], "current_user_reaction": null, "reaction_users_count": 0, "current_user_used_main_reaction": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false, "topic_accepted_answer": true}
