My JSON matches the titles of the movies as in the website, but in portal it is showing error and expecting something different from what is given in the website. How to handle this ?

contradiction :  
" 2. Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey" (in web page) & ( delivered by the JSON)  
" 2. Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey" (expected in portal ) & ( raising error statement )
