Alright so in Q4 of W4, We have to extract weather forecast data from bbc servers for a given city. The city I have been given Nur-Sultan is not present in the bbc data base, it appears the city is now known as Astana and is listed in the bbc database as Astana.  
Since Nur-Sultan doesn’t exist in the bbc database, all of my attempts to extract data for it were meet with failure. So I extracted the data for Astana and pasted it in the portal but that doesn’t work as well and throws the following error “TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading ‘id’)”  
What am I suppose to do? [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)

Below is the data for Astana that I was able to extract, Since Nur-Sultan doesn’t exist in the bbc database:
