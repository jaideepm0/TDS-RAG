i 'm here for the bonus marks,

But since i am here. Just want to appreciate the course and your efforts towards this.

We need more “teachers” like you, who really puts an extra effort in the course.

And i have never seen any course cool as this,

* like appreciating tweaking things, using dev console to tweak things, keep the code checks on client side (*and as S Anand’s Student i have leveraged that freedom ![:sweat_smile:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/sweat_smile.png?v=12 ":sweat_smile:"), gave client side answer checks’s code to `o1` and it reverse engineered the minifed code, and lots of question were solved by that only, but really curious on how others are doing this*)
* keeping the cutting edge tech in course, like function calling from OpenAI.  
  ( *i have seen some students solutions, they were using regex to solve that problem ![:smiling_face_with_tear:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/smiling_face_with_tear.png?v=12 ":smiling_face_with_tear:")*)
