I have manually adjusted several values based on the expected format. This issue is specific to the year field.</p>\n<p>I use different classes to extract values for various fields. Could there be any other element on the portal affecting this extraction?</p>\n<p>In Q4, one of my classmates is encountering a \u201croot property\u201d error despite using the same extraction method as I do. Upon checking, I found that this issue occurs because the city\u2019s time is displayed as the previous day compared to our time. The portal results seem to be based on the city\u2019s actual time rather than IST.<br>\nI would appreciate your guidance on these issues.</p>", "post_number": 148, "post_type": 1, "posts_count": 370, "updated_at": "2025-02-08T06:42:27.773Z", "reply_count": 2, "reply_to_post_number": null, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 2, "reads": 95, "readers_count": 94, "score": 38.6, "yours": false, "topic_id": 165959, "topic_slug": "ga4-data-sourcing-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025", "display_username": "LAKSHAY", "primary_group_name": "ds-students", "flair_name": "ds-students", "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": "", "flair_color": "", "flair_group_id": 294, "badges_granted": [], "version": 1, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_see_hidden_post": false, "can_wiki": false, "read": true, "user_title": null, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [{"id": 2, "can_act": true}, {"id": 6, "can_act": true}, {"id": 3, "can_act": true}, {"id": 4, "can_act": true}, {"id": 8, "can_act": true}, {"id": 10, "can_act": true}, {"id": 7, "can_act": true}], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 7193, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 1, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "post_url": "/t/ga4-data-sourcing-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/165959/148", "user_cakedate": "2021-09-12", "reactions": [], "current_user_reaction": null, "reaction_users_count": 0, "current_user_used_main_reaction": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false, "topic_accepted_answer": null}
