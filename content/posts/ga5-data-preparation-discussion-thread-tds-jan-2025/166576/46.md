Q5 fixed, thanks for fixing the issue.

Now we are struggling with Q8.  
MY q8 is : Write a DuckDB SQL query to find all posts IDs after 2025-01-09T12:36:14.085Z with at least 1 comment with 4 useful stars, sorted. The result should be a table with a single column called `post_id` , and the relevant post IDs should be sorted in ascending order.  
when i use below query, i get some some result, a table of post\_id but error : **Error**: At root: Array length mismatch  
**Reason**: below query checking only 1st comment (`$[0]` refers to the first comment in the array) we have to check all comments not 1st.  
But when i change the query to check any one comment its giving different types of error.

```
WITH filtered_posts AS (
  SELECT post_id
  FROM social_media
  WHERE timestamp >= '2025-01-09T09:48:01.303Z'
    AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM social_media AS sm
      WHERE json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') IS NOT NULL
        AND CAST(json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') AS INTEGER) > 4
    )
)
SELECT post_id
FROM filtered_posts
ORDER BY post_id ASC;

```

Kindly check if any issue with Q8.  
May be my query is wrong or may be not.

Thankyou
