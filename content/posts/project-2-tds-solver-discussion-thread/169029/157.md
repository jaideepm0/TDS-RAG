I am bit confused about answer evaluation process. Can you tell which one is correct process.  
1st process ( I used json.dumps() to get my\_response as json formatted string)

2nd process ( This one is Json object)

or both are incorrect?

This is one more example of 1st process after json.loads() it gave me correct format for assignment portal answer:

This is one more example of 2nd process without use of json.loads() it gave me correct format for assignment portal answer:
