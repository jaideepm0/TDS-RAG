Respected Course Team,

Harsh this side from NIT Allahabad, I am writing to inform you that I received a notification  

[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/4/7/47982d17f0f05b64a27e4f066b996127987dadf9_2_690x379.png)

regarding an issue with my submission.

I believe the issue may have occurred because I had mistakenly provided an incorrect API endpoint in my earlier submission. However, my server is still actively running on Vercel  
<https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app>  
and the correct API endpoint is:

correct api : <https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app/api/>

Everything else in the project is functioning as expected. I kindly request you to re-evaluate my submission using the correct endpoint as i am currently in my 3rd year of BTech Chemical engineering at NIT Allahabad and my placement session is coming so i don’t want to get failed in this course due to such a small mistake.

Thank you for your understanding and support.
