If we wanted to do that, I could just go random GitHub repos and solve and create pull requests for a specific bug. Also we end up losing interest thinking most if the course instructors don\u2019t what they are doing. I understand Anand Sir is extremely busy(like really busy lol), but what are the course instructors doing?</p>", "post_number": 35, "post_type": 1, "posts_count": 690, "updated_at": "2025-03-07T06:35:16.767Z", "reply_count": 0, "reply_to_post_number": 32, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 2, "reads": 300, "readers_count": 299, "score": 84.6, "yours": false, "topic_id": 169029, "topic_slug": "project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread", "display_username": "Andrew David", "primary_group_name": "ds-students", "flair_name": "ds-students", "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": "", "flair_color": "", "flair_group_id": 294, "badges_granted": [], "version": 3, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_see_hidden_post": false, "can_wiki": false, "read": false, "user_title": null, "reply_to_user": {"id": 13078, "username": "Saransh_Saini", "name": "Saransh Saini", "avatar_template": "/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/saransh_saini/{size}/123495_2.png"}, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [{"id": 2, "count": 1, "can_act": true}, {"id": 6, "can_act": true}, {"id": 3, "can_act": true}, {"id": 4, "can_act": true}, {"id": 8, "can_act": true}, {"id": 10, "can_act": true}, {"id": 7, "can_act": true}], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 18297, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 1, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "post_url": "/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/35", "user_cakedate": "2023-06-05", "user_birthdate": "1904-01-05", "reactions": [{"id": "heart", "type": "emoji", "count": 1}], "current_user_reaction": null, "reaction_users_count": 1, "current_user_used_main_reaction": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false, "topic_accepted_answer": null}
