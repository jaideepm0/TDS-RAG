[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) I just wanted to bring to your attention that in GA4 question 2, the answer evaluation script expects the movie title as “17. Kraven: The Hunter” but it is actually listed on the IMDb page as “17. Kraven the Hunter”, resulting in the correct one being marked wrong.  
No questions here just wanted to bring it to attention so that it does not affect the project evaluation script.
