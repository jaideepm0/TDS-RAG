Hi TAs,

I attended the meet which happened today. But I donâ€™t clearly get one thing.

Most of the questions have a **question text** and a **file: csv,zip,json,etc**

My doubt is, will the request to the end point be :

```
curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=question text" \
  -F "file=https://stats.espncricinfo.com/stats/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;template=results;type=batting"

```

> my doubt :  
> Is this the only format or can there be other too ?
