Respected Sir,

I kindly request a deadline extension of at least 3 minutes for the project submission, similar to what was done for ROE. Due to slow internet connectivity and the absence of WiFi, my submission took longer than usual. As a result, I was only able to upload it at 12:01 AM instead of the regular 11:59 PM deadline.  
PLEASE Sir, As I’m a standalone student and this is my primary degree after 12th, please do accept it.

Thank you
