Hello Sir,  
I hope you’re doing well. On behalf of all the students in our course, I wanted to request a deadline extension for the project 2. We’re all putting in our best effort, but we need a little more time to complete it properly.

If it’s possible to grant an extension, we would really appreciate it. Please let us know if you can consider this request.

Thank you for your time and understanding!  
Saksham

Please sir !
