Do all of us have to give the latest project link or only those whose links have actually changed. [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj).

Basically should we resubmit the link using the form sent today if our link has not changed?

PS: Maybe send a mail to everyone to update the access of their GA7 links to viewer for everyone at IIT Madras.
