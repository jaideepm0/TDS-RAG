I\u2019d like to share a few reflections\u2014not as criticism, but as constructive feedback with the intention to contribute positively to future iterations.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Organization &amp; Structure:</strong><br>\nThe project felt a bit unstructured at times, which may be expected given that this is possibly the first time such an initiative is being carried out. I\u2019m not blaming anyone\u2014just sharing my thoughts. I hope positive insights can be drawn from this feedback.</li>\n<li><strong>Deployment &amp; Portal Limitations:</strong><br>\nThere are noticeable limitations on the deployment side (e.g., timeouts, platform constraints) and occasional issues on the assignment portal. While frustrating, these also led to some deep technical learning.</li>\n<li><strong>Time Constraints:</strong><br>\nBalancing this project with ongoing coursework and other responsibilities has been quite demanding. The deadline of March 31st adds pressure, making it difficult to thoroughly test all 57 questions across different environments.</li>\n<li><strong>Sessions &amp; Support:</strong><br>\nThe sessions conducted were helpful in addressing specific topics, but in many areas, I had to rely heavily on GPT and self-guided exploration to move forward.</li>\n<li><strong>Deployment Variability:</strong><br>\nEach GA\u2019s questions seemed to expose different limitations depending on the deployment platform. This inconsistency made it hard to predict which questions would work reliably.</li>\n<li><strong>Effort Acknowledgment:</strong><br>\nI sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TAs and instructors\u2014it\u2019s clear that a lot of hard work went into enabling and supporting this project. However, it\u2019s also a bit disappointing that we, as students, are unsure which questions are expected to work and which may fail\u2014even the team might not have full visibility over this at the moment.</li>\n<li><strong>Feasibility in the Given Timeline:</strong><br>\nEven for someone with a technical background, it\u2019s difficult to troubleshoot and experiment across so many cases within the current timeline. Trying different approaches per question isn\u2019t always feasible before the deadline.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p>I genuinely hope someone is able to complete <strong>all 57 questions</strong> successfully\u2014I\u2019d love to learn from their experience and solutions.</p>\n<p>Again, this post is meant in a positive and constructive spirit. If anything I said seems inappropriate or off the mark, please let me know\u2014I\u2019m happy to edit or delete the post if needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you for the learning opportunity</strong></p>", "post_number": 127, "post_type": 1, "posts_count": 690, "updated_at": "2025-03-27T11:44:22.625Z", "reply_count": 1, "reply_to_post_number": null, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 2, "reads": 143, "readers_count": 142, "score": 58.4, "yours": false, "topic_id": 169029, "topic_slug": "project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread", "display_username": "LAKSHAY", "primary_group_name": "ds-students", "flair_name": "ds-students", "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": "", "flair_color": "", "flair_group_id": 294, "badges_granted": [], "version": 2, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_see_hidden_post": false, "can_wiki": false, "read": false, "user_title": null, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [{"id": 2, "count": 1, "can_act": true}, {"id": 6, "can_act": true}, {"id": 3, "can_act": true}, {"id": 4, "can_act": true}, {"id": 8, "can_act": true}, {"id": 10, "can_act": true}, {"id": 7, "can_act": true}], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 7193, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 1, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "post_url": "/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/127", "user_cakedate": "2021-09-12", "reactions": [{"id": "heart", "type": "emoji", "count": 1}], "current_user_reaction": null, "reaction_users_count": 1, "current_user_used_main_reaction": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false, "topic_accepted_answer": null}
