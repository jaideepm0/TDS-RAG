I faced the same issue. Initially, I used `geopy.geocoders` to solve the question, and it provided the correct answer during the assignment submission. However, the same approach is now giving an incorrect result.

Instead of using `geopy`, try using this URL directly: <https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search> .  
This worked for me.
