I just want to know if you prefer using an existing language model application where we utilize an LLM (Large Language Model), train it, and format the output. For instance, I used the Gemini API key, integrated it with Python, and then formatted the results with the help of Copilot to achieve the desired outputs.

Alternatively, do you want us to create a new LLM model and train it with questions from graded assignments? I’m curious about your preference.

Additionally, would you like the LLM to provide specific answers regarding computer specifications, or should it give general specifications? For example, in Graded Assignment 1, there is a question about the editor: Visual Studio Code.

Your editor is the most important tool in your arsenal; that’s where you’ll spend most of your time, so make sure you’re comfortable with it.

Visual Studio Code is, by far, the most popular code editor today. According to the 2024 Stack Overflow Survey, almost 75% of developers use it. We recommend you learn it well. Even if you use another editor, you’ll likely work with others who use VS Code, so having some exposure is beneficial.

To get started, you can watch these introductory videos (totaling 35 minutes) from the Visual Studio Docs:

* Getting Started: Set up and learn the basics of Visual Studio Code (7 min)
* Code Editing: Learn how to edit and run code in VS Code (3 min)
* Productivity Tips: Become a VS Code power user with these productivity tips (4 min)
* Personalize: Personalize VS Code to make it yours with themes (2 min)
* Extensions: Add features, themes, and more to VS Code with extensions (4 min)
* Debugging: Get started with debugging in VS Code (6 min)
* Version Control: Learn how to use Git version control in VS Code (3 min)
* Customize: Learn how to customize your settings and keyboard shortcuts in VS Code (6 min)

AI Editors: Copilot, Cursor
---------------------------

Note: AI editors like Cursor, Cody, and GitHub Copilot use LLMs to help you write code faster. These tools are built on top of VS Code and have become standard in every developer’s toolkit. Please make sure to use them.

To install and run Visual Studio Code, open your Terminal (or Command Prompt) and type `code -s`, then press Enter. Copy and paste the entire output below.

What is the output of `code -s`? The output of `code -s` cannot be universally answered because it depends on the user’s system and the specific version of VS Code installed. The question requests the output of a command that is unique to each user.

As for the part about getting answers from the LLM model, I believe that may require using an AI agent. I am currently searching for a solution for this, and I would like to know your thoughts on it.
