Hello,

I wanted to provide an update regarding the issue I faced while I was in Jammu. During my stay, my laptop was on, but I encountered an error that caused my endpoint to crash. It seemed that Cloudflared mentioned needing an update, which I believe contributed to the problem.

Now that I’m back in Delhi, I’m connected to the internet, and I’m happy to report that my endpoint is working again.

see this image I have designed my endpoint to monitor with discord webhook
