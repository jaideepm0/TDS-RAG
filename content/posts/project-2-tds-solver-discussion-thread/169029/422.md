Sir, I saw from the logs on Cloud Run that my project was probably evaluated on 5th April at around 11:51 PM and all the requests made during that time resulted in 3 response status codes: 302, 307 and 405 by no fault of my app, but rather errors in the request itself. I mentioned the exactly correct URL of my app in the form but the evaluation logs show three different types of URL to which request was made. As I mentioned in the form, my url is of the format “https://…/api/” and allows only POST requests.

1. The app was supposed to allow POST requests and I allowed only POST requests, so GET requests even to correct url resulted in 405 response
2. When POST requests were actually made, two wrong urls were used for all the POST requests  
   a. http://…/api/ → resulted in 302 response  
   b. https://…/api → resulted in a 307  
   whereas the url I gave was of the format “https://…/api/”

The logs from Cloud Run

As you can see from the above logs, all POST requests made to my app have the wrong url, some have only http and some end with “/api” instead of “/api/”, both of which do not match with the correct url I gave in the Google Form (screenshot attached below).

I request you to re-evaluate my project 2 with the correct url exactly as I had submitted in the Google Form.

Thank you.
