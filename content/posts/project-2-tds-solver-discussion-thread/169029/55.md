The key learning objective for Project 2 is for you to be absolutely comfortable interacting with APIs and understanding how they work to perform tasks.

So there is very little need for the use of LLMs or agents.

1. Identify the the question being asked (how you do this is upto you, you can be as simplistic as using regex to look for some key words, or you can be clever and create embeddings out of the original question and calculate the similarity from the request)
2. Create a function that solves the question with the required parameters and inputs. Remember this does not have to be fancy. Just compute the answer. You do not need to do the task as the GA required. You ONLY want the answer. No tools required. Just a computed answer.
3. Give the answer back as specified.

Kind regards
