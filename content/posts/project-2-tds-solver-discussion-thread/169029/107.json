Kindly verify these points before evaluation.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-611536-questions-requiring-manual-intervention-portal-side-issue-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-611536-questions-requiring-manual-intervention-portal-side-issue-2\"></a><img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/red_exclamation_mark.png?v=14\" title=\":red_exclamation_mark:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":red_exclamation_mark:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Questions Requiring Manual Intervention / Portal-Side Issue</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>GA3 Q8</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Issue: The question doesn\u2019t mention all required queries. Although all mentioned queries were added, the portal seems to check for additional queries not stated, resulting in an incorrect answer flag.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>GA3 Q9</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Issue: This question asks to create an LLM prompt, but upon submission, a pop-up requests the AIPROXY_TOKEN.</li>\n<li>Clarification needed: How are we supposed to handle token-based inputs for evaluation?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>GA4 Q2 &amp; Q10</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Issue: Previously encountered issues have been resolved.</li>\n<li>Reference: <a href=\"https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/98\">GA4 Q2 and Q10 resolution</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Output Formatting (Multiple Questions)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Issue: When using plain text, the answer is accepted. However, in JSON format, newline characters (\\n) and backslashes are added.</li>\n<li>Note: As per the project requirement, the output should be in JSON like {\u201canswer\u201d: \u201cresult\u201d}. But directly copy-pasting such a result with special characters leads to rejection by the portal.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Vercel / Docker Hub / Ngrok Deployment Questions</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Issue: Some deployment-related questions require a **live-running server, which needs real-time manual deployment using platforms like Vercel or Ngrok.</li>\n<li>Clarification needed: How is this expected to be evaluated?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-611536-deployment-related-issues-to-be-included-in-thursdays-session-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-611536-deployment-related-issues-to-be-included-in-thursdays-session-3\"></a>Deployment-Related Issues (To Be Included in Thursday\u2019s Session)</h2>\n<p>Please include discussion and solutions for the following deployment issues:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Platform Capability for GA Tasks</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Which cloud platform (Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.) can handle all GA tasks reliably?</li>\n<li>Note: Some platforms have limitations that block certain tasks or token usage.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>File Upload Example via Platform API</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Request: Please provide examples for both small and large file uploads using API from a cloud-deployed app.</li>\n<li>This would help validate deployments for assignment questions involving file input.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>General Observations on GA1-5<br>\nOutput Accuracy: Approximately 80% of the questions in GA1-5 return correct output when tested on a local machine.
