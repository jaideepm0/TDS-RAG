I have secured reasonably good grades in all the courses. However, I failed TDS the last term and I am likely to fail in this term too. The reason is, I got bad marks in both ROE and I have never submitted any project, i.e., I have not submitted 3 TDS projects in the last two terms and did badly in the first project of the previous term.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-614585-my-initial-disappointments-with-this-course-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-614585-my-initial-disappointments-with-this-course-2\"></a>My Initial Disappointments with this Course</h2>\n<p>In one of the orientation session, I heard Andrew sir say this (subject to correction):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The video lectures are the primary content. It is not compulsory to attend the live sessions, but it is highly recommended.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Here, the most important resource are the live sessions. I did not like it. Till now, I have managed all the courses with faculty lectures alone. I rarely watch live sessions. I didn\u2019t like watching live sessions. I felt it was against what is pointed out in the previous paragraph</li>\n<li>ROE is just for forty five minutes, with around 10 questions. I felt that this is rubbish and unthoughtful.</li>\n<li>There are not many videos explaining the tools (from IIT side). Only a few videos. Most of the tools are explained through text. I felt that a the purpose of a college course is to explain things in a simple way so that we can learn it easily.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-614585-why-did-i-fail-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-614585-why-did-i-fail-3\"></a>Why did I fail?</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-614585-last-term-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-614585-last-term-4\"></a>Last Term</h3>\n<p>I dumped myself with a 3 more courses, projects and nptel courses. I didn\u2019t practice the GAs properly. So I failed ROE. I will come to the projects soon.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-614585-this-term-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-614585-this-term-5\"></a>This term.</h2>\n<p>I made sure that I do all the GAs properly. But I did better than last time in ROE but still bad. This time because, other than GAs, I didn\u2019t allocate time for ROE. Also, I didn\u2019t submit both the projects.</p>\n<p>In both the terms I didn\u2019t collaborate with anyone. I felt that I shouldn\u2019t earn my marks be talking help from someone. I felt it is not fair.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-614585-me-understanding-about-the-course-now-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-614585-me-understanding-about-the-course-now-6\"></a>Me Understanding about the Course Now</h2>\n<p>This one line changed my view about ROE.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote group-faculty\" data-username=\"s.anand\" data-post=\"2\" data-topic=\"99838\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/s.anand/48/15264_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"><a href=\"/t/99838/2\">On another topic</a></div>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>What does this RoE evaluate?</strong> Implicit learning.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>I am reasonably ok with python and all the tools in this course. But in ROE, I was not able to write a nested for loop, which was needed for some question. It is not that I don\u2019t know how to write a simple nested loop. I discovered the fact that I have not coded enough.</p>\n<p>I scored 100 in all the OPPEs : python, java, PDSA, DBMS. I knew the concepts. But the questions were not difficult and the time was ample. This is not the case in TDS.</p>\n<p>Now I realize that  I am not good in SQL or DSA. It is just the questions were easy and was accompanied with ample time.</p>\n<p>In MLP, I score just 40 in OPPE 1, this was because of me not practicing <code>SKLearn</code>. Then I practiced and got 90 in the second OPPE.</p>\n<p>This course has made me realise that till I need to learn relearn these things in an <em><strong>implicit</strong></em> way.</p>\n<p>This is the exact reason why I have not been able to complete the projects. I still know most of the things required for project 1 and 2. But I was not able to practically sit and write the code.</p>\n<p>I have understood that this is not a traditional course. I feel that we must expect something different from this course. Especially not just marks</p>\n<p>I have understood that the limited amount of recorded lectures for is a way to make the students to practically go through the documentation. Understand the complex phrasing of some functionalities, etc.</p>\n<p>I am most likely to take this course again. I feel extremely bad to have wasted 15000 rupees. But this course has been a wake up call for me. I still feel that I have the potential to do this course way better than this. What I would have to do is a lot more coding of what I have already learnt.</p>\n<p>From the other project courses, I had a wrong assumption that projects are about applying what we have learnt. This was also a reason why I didn\u2019t do my projects in TDS. I felt that the course team didn\u2019t cover all the essentials of a projects. I have now realized that projects are about applying what we know and also learn new things which will enhance our projects.</p>\n<p>Since this is not a traditional course, I also feel that it is fine to collaborate and seek help, at the same time, strive to contribute to others too.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/s.anand\">@s.anand</a> , <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/carlton\">@carlton</a> , <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/jivraj\">@Jivraj</a>  and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/saransh_saini\">@Saransh_Saini</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Just two suggestions</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>I feel that MAD 2 and MLP should be corequisites.</li>\n<li>While introducing the projects, kindly include a video where the flow of the project is explained.
