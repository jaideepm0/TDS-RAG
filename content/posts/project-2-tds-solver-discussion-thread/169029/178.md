What Jivraj agreed was stringifying the answer and putting it in as the value of the `"answer"` key in the JSON object.  
`{ "answer" : "YOUR_STRINGIFIED_ANSWER" }`

Just check the Project 2 page on the portal. It’s clearly mentioned a JSON object has to sent not a strigified version of the entire JSON object.
