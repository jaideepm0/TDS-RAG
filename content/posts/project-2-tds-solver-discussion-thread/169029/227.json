I request the timeout to be at least 40-60 seconds as yt-dlp and faster-whisper take take to download the audio, load the model and run it on cpu and get the transcription.<br>\nFor 259.7 to 351.8 seconds, it is taking around 1.5 mins, but it is giving the correct answer.</p>\n<p>So I request you to shorten the length of the audio or increase the request timeout or both in moderation.</p>\n<p>Question \u2014&gt; the \u201cquestion\u201d sent to the api will have the youtube video link, right? Or since the video is same for everyone, can I just have the audio file ready in the project? Will the api be tested against any YouTube video other than the Mystery Story Audiobook link given in the GA question?</p>\n<p>Edit: Even with a preprocessed audio file (mp3, speech optimized, 32K), what\u2019s taking the longest time is joining the transcribed sentences into a single string. That alone is taking &gt;50 seconds. Please suggest a way to make it faster.</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nShivaditya</p>", "post_number": 227, "post_type": 1, "posts_count": 690, "updated_at": "2025-03-31T08:53:48.482Z", "reply_count": 0, "reply_to_post_number": null, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 3, "reads": 162, "readers_count": 161, "score": 47.2, "yours": false, "topic_id": 169029, "topic_slug": "project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread", "display_username": "Shivaditya Bhattacharya", "primary_group_name": "ds-students", "flair_name": "ds-students", "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": "", "flair_color": "", "flair_group_id": 294, "badges_granted": [], "version": 5, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_see_hidden_post": false, "can_wiki": false, "read": true, "user_title": "", "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [{"id": 2, "can_act": true}, {"id": 6, "can_act": true}, {"id": 3, "can_act": true}, {"id": 4, "can_act": true}, {"id": 8, "can_act": true}, {"id": 10, "can_act": true}, {"id": 7, "can_act": true}], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 16002, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 1, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "post_url": "/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/227", "user_cakedate": "2023-01-25", "user_birthdate": "1904-03-07", "reactions": [], "current_user_reaction": null, "reaction_users_count": 0, "current_user_used_main_reaction": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false, "topic_accepted_answer": null}
