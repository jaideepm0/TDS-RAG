I have few questions just going through the Project 2 problem statement.

1. Are we supposed to use OpenAI api’s or locally/private hosted one?
2. Many of the questions need files or images or audio files as input, same api is expected to handle those also?
3. Can we work in a team and submit the project together?
4. If we are to use locally hosted llm system, our systems are not strong enough to run most of the good ones locally
5. Is it possible to get a TA to collaborate in our project as an observer?

awaiting a response.

Thank you…
