Humble Request to Update API Request Link
-----------------------------------------

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to kindly ask if it would be possible to update my API request link for project 2 in TDS. I realized that I mistakenly used the wrong endpoint in my earlier request.

**Previous API Request Link:**

![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/a/aae809b0bbff330e7cec1d2f6ae9eb8551d928c2.png)
[project2llm-production.up.railway.app](https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/docs)

### [IITM Assignment API - Swagger UI](https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/docs)

**Correct API Request Link:**  
<https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/>  
<https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/>

Would it be possible for you to allow me to make this change, or kindly update the link on my behalf? I sincerely apologize for the confusion, and I’d be truly grateful for your support and understanding.

Thank you so much for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,  
Pratyush Pulak Nishhank
