Letâ€™s make sure you know how to use JSON. Sort this JSON array of objects by the value of the `age` field. In case of a tie, sort by the `name` field. Paste the resulting JSON below without any spaces or newlines.

```
[{"name":"Alice","age":67},{"name":"Bob","age":53},{"name":"Charlie","age":34},{"name":"David","age":89},{"name":"Emma","age":92},{"name":"Frank","age":37},{"name":"Grace","age":4},{"name":"Henry","age":49},{"name":"Ivy","age":30},{"name":"Jack","age":2},{"name":"Karen","age":2},{"name":"Liam","age":5},{"name":"Mary","age":32},{"name":"Nora","age":56},{"name":"Oscar","age":19},{"name":"Paul","age":22}]

```
