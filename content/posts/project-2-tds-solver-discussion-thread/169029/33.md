If you are indicating towards working collaboratively then,  
Yes, we encourage you to collaborate with others and collectively work towards solving this project. Even if you are going for the relatively easiest approach of Function Calling, it would require you to code about 50 functions to solve all your tasks. Which is why it is sensible to work collectively.
