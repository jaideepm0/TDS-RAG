As per the portal, we have to return a JSON object as a response from the API. However, if we load a JSON object directly using `json.load()`, it will throw an error. We need to first convert it into a JSON string and then load it using `json.loads( )`. For clarity I add image below.

This question has been stretched for too long—it’s not that big.
