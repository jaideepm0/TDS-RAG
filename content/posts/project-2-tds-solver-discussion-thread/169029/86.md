For questions like this (there’s a similar one in GA1 too, will the user send the USER and REPO of their GitHub account as parameters too?  
Even if they do, my script may not get necessary authentication to create repo and make commit in their repository. In this case, would I have to implement GitHub OAuth flow?  
If they don’t send those details but just the email and I am expected to just change the email in my own repo and commit, in the worst case making the same change repeatedly may be misconstrued as a DDoS attack by an automated script which may lead to my GitHub account being suspended, which does not seem ideal.  
Can you please at least hint at a solution?

Edit: Same query for the GitHub actions question (GA2 Q7)

Another edit: A similar query for GA2 Q8. Repeated dockerimage pushes to Dockerhub with different tags.
