I noticed that ngrok disconnects after two hours, so I’m wondering if we can continue using it.

If your team was aware of this, I’d like to understand why it was allowed to deploy on ngrok. I typically use Vercel for deployment, but as you know, Vercel doesn’t support certain features.  
what to do now
