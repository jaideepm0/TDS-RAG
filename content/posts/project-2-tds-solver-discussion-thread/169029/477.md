I just got the mail stating that my evaluation is complete and I can turn off my server.  
However the Cloud Run logs show that all POST requests were made to the wrong end point.

The exact url I gave ends with “/api/” but every POST request was either made to “/api” which resulted in a 307 response or with “http” instead of “https” which resulted in a 302 response. Only the get requests were made to the correct endpoint but since the app was supposed to allow POST requests only, making GET requests just resulted in 405.

I request you to use the exact url I gave in the gform and make POST requests to it to re-evaluate me. I gave the exact url as asked in the form.
