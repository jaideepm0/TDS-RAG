### **Final Thoughts on Project 2**

Project 2 has been a valuable yet challenging experience. I’d like to share a few reflections—not as criticism, but as constructive feedback with the intention to contribute positively to future iterations.

1. **Organization & Structure:**  
   The project felt a bit unstructured at times, which may be expected given that this is possibly the first time such an initiative is being carried out. I’m not blaming anyone—just sharing my thoughts. I hope positive insights can be drawn from this feedback.
2. **Deployment & Portal Limitations:**  
   There are noticeable limitations on the deployment side (e.g., timeouts, platform constraints) and occasional issues on the assignment portal. While frustrating, these also led to some deep technical learning.
3. **Time Constraints:**  
   Balancing this project with ongoing coursework and other responsibilities has been quite demanding. The deadline of March 31st adds pressure, making it difficult to thoroughly test all 57 questions across different environments.
4. **Sessions & Support:**  
   The sessions conducted were helpful in addressing specific topics, but in many areas, I had to rely heavily on GPT and self-guided exploration to move forward.
5. **Deployment Variability:**  
   Each GA’s questions seemed to expose different limitations depending on the deployment platform. This inconsistency made it hard to predict which questions would work reliably.
6. **Effort Acknowledgment:**  
   I sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TAs and instructors—it’s clear that a lot of hard work went into enabling and supporting this project. However, it’s also a bit disappointing that we, as students, are unsure which questions are expected to work and which may fail—even the team might not have full visibility over this at the moment.
7. **Feasibility in the Given Timeline:**  
   Even for someone with a technical background, it’s difficult to troubleshoot and experiment across so many cases within the current timeline. Trying different approaches per question isn’t always feasible before the deadline.

I genuinely hope someone is able to complete **all 57 questions** successfully—I’d love to learn from their experience and solutions.

Again, this post is meant in a positive and constructive spirit. If anything I said seems inappropriate or off the mark, please let me know—I’m happy to edit or delete the post if needed.

**Thank you for the learning opportunity**
