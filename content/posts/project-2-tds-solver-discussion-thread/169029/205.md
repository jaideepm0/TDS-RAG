I am going to clarify this once and for all  
The response should be a **JSON Object** with the value of the `"answer"` key as a string.

```
{ "answer" : "YOUR_ANSWER_AS_STRING" }

```

This is the way we are expecting your responses.  
However, due to the heavy confusion among students and will be considering responses with entire JSON objects stringified. We donâ€™t want anyone to loose their marks for such a miniscule error.  
So,

```
"{\"answer\": \"YOUR_ANSWER\"}"

```

is also valid.
