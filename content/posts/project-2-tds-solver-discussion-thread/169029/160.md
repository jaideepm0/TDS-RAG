I am trying to create a student account on Microsoft Azure using my IIT Madras email ID (**23f2004705@ds.study.iitm.ac.in**), but I am encountering an issue. The system is showing a message that my email domain is not currently registered with them, and it is asking me to use another verification method.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) Could you please guide me on how to proceed with the verification or if there is an alternative method to access Azure’s student benefits?
