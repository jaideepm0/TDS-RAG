Your Dockerfile was misconfigured. When we try to build the docker image from your github repo, we get this error:

`tried copying parent folder(COPY failed: forbidden path outside the build context: .. ())`

You have to replicate the test environment. If it works when you follow this test setup then you should get in touch with us.
