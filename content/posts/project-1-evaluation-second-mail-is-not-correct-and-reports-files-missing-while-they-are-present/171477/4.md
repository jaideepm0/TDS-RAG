Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton),

I’m experiencing the same issue mentioned in this thread regarding Project 1 evaluation emails:

1. The first email I received confirmed all requirements were met (public repo, MIT License, Dockerfile, etc.)
2. The second email incorrectly flagged missing files despite their presence in my repository

Here are screenshots of both emails showing the discrepancy:

My GitHub repo remains publicly accessible with all required components:

Could you please confirm this was an automated error and that my submission will be evaluated based on the actual repository contents? Your clarification would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and assistance!
