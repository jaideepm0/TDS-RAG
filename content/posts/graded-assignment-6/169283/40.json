The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant Harbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit Shores Village : (42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836) &amp; Central Command Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs Community. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance</p>\n<p>10418 meters</p>\n<p>12287 meters</p>\n<p>10965 meters</p>\n<p>11149 meters</p>\n<p>Whose right answer turned out 6873, however the answer pushed is 12287 meters, which is nowhere near the closest options (it would\u2019ve been correct if the destination was summit shores village which isn\u2019t the case with this question)</p>\n<p>Also, my question 4 was :<br>\nAs an investment analyst monitoring motorcycle resale values, develop a forecasting model to predict future resale prices by brand and segment, considering seasonality and long-term trends.
