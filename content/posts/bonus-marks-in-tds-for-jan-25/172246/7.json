Initially, we were told that GA would carry 15% weight, calculated as the best 4 out of 7. Based on this, after scoring full marks in four GAs, I didn\u2019t attempt the rest. Even then, I did complete GA5 and GA6, which you can verify.</p>\n<p>Now I\u2019m seeing in groups that there\u2019s an \u201cextra benefit\u201d being given for GA7. If any changes are being made to the evaluation criteria, they should be communicated clearly via email or discourse. Transparency is important, and as students, we have the right to be informed about such decisions in advance.</p>\n<p>I could point out several other issues, but to keep it brief \u2014 grading should be fair and consistent. Every student deserves an equal opportunity, and if GA7 is being considered differently, everyone should have the chance to attempt or review it accordingly.</p>\n<p><strong><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/carlton\">@carlton</a></strong>, we request you to kindly consider this matter. We are looking forward to a quick response \u2014 hopefully one that ensures fairness for all students.</p>", "post_number": 7, "post_type": 1, "posts_count": 52, "updated_at": "2025-04-09T13:25:30.418Z", "reply_count": 2, "reply_to_post_number": 2, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 33, "reads": 179, "readers_count": 178, "score": 314.2, "yours": false, "topic_id": 172246, "topic_slug": "bonus-marks-in-tds-for-jan-25", "display_username": "ABHIJEET KUMAR ", "primary_group_name": "ds-students", "flair_name": "ds-students", "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": "", "flair_color": "", "flair_group_id": 294, "badges_granted": [], "version": 1, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_see_hidden_post": false, "can_wiki": false, "read": true, "user_title": null, "reply_to_user": {"id": 7193, "username": "lakshaygarg654", "name": "LAKSHAY", "avatar_template": "/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/lakshaygarg654/{size}/129814_2.png"}, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [{"id": 2, "count": 7, "can_act": true}, {"id": 6, "can_act": true}, {"id": 3, "can_act": true}, {"id": 4, "can_act": true}, {"id": 8, "can_act": true}, {"id": 10, "can_act": true}, {"id": 7, "can_act": true}], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 21980, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 1, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "post_url": "/t/bonus-marks-in-tds-for-jan-25/172246/7", "user_cakedate": "2023-09-18", "reactions": [{"id": "heart", "type": "emoji", "count": 6}, {"id": "+1", "type": "emoji", "count": 1}], "current_user_reaction": null, "reaction_users_count": 7, "current_user_used_main_reaction": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false, "topic_accepted_answer": null}
