I have the utmost respect for the grading system and for the esteemed professors at IITM, and I deeply value the effort put into the course.</p>\n<p>However, as a student, I am hoping to clarify the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course.</p>\n<p>Addressing the queries you raised in your post:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>What is the policy related to bonus for Diploma level courses as per grading policy document?</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In previous modules, such as Project 1, bonus marks were awarded for completing additional tasks (1 bonus mark per task if the code handled them correctly). Similarly, in GA4, bonus marks were given for replying in Discourse. These bonus marks, however, were specific to the respective modules and did not affect the final grading.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>What is the policy adopted in previous instances of TDS?</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am not fully aware of the policies adopted in previous terms for the TDS course.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Did anyone read the text related to bonus marks associated with GA7?</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have read the email regarding GA7 and the associated bonus marks. The email states that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dear Learner,<br>\nDEADLINE: 10th April, 2025 23:59:59pm<br>\nGA7 requires you to submit 3 peer evaluations, so that you may be graded for your submission.<br>\nPlease find the form link below to submit your evaluations.<br>\n<a href=\"https://forms.gle/DhBW4xdKyv7hXhXD9\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://forms.gle/DhBW4xdKyv7hXhXD9</a><br>\nAFTER completing your initial 3 peer reviews which were sent in the previous email,<br>\nif you submit 5 additional reviews, you will be awarded upto 5 BONUS MARKS to your final T score. For example if your final TDS score is 75, doing all 5 extra peer reviews can boost your final score in TDS to 80.<br>\nYou will have to submit the form 5 times (1 for each peer). Use the same form link to submit 5 different reviews. Your Bonus score will still be based on the metrics derived for the initial 3 peer reviews, but scaled for 5 peer reviews.<br>\nYou have been given the peer submissions as links to HTML files which you have to download and view in a browser.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Does anyone know what should be done to get the bonus?</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From the information in the email, I infer that students who complete the additional reviews are eligible for bonus marks, which will be added to their overall total marks.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Has anyone inquired about effort involved in getting the bonus?</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My peers and I have worked diligently to complete all required tasks, including the ROE and projects. Earning additional bonus marks is certainly a challenging milestone, and we understand that it requires considerable effort.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>After answering all the above, has someone actually tried to follow instructions in the \u201cmail\u201d to get the bonus?</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately, I can\u2019t follow the instructions because I did not receive the email about submitting extra peer reviews, as it appears to have been sent to those who participated in GA7.<br>\n\u2026</p>\n<p>Given this context, I would appreciate it if you could kindly clarify the situation for students who completed all GAs from 1 to 6 (or did their best 4 GAs) but did not participate in GA7. Specifically, I would like to understand why only those who completed GA7 are receiving the bonus marks email regarding peer reviews.</p>\n<p>Please note that I ask this purely for clarification and with the utmost respect for the professors and the grading system, as I have no intention of creating controversy. I simply wish to understand the criteria.<br>\nThank you for your time and consideration <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/jkmadathil\">@jkmadathil</a> sir.</p>\n<p>Best regards,<br>\nAkshit Mittal</p>", "post_number": 27, "post_type": 1, "posts_count": 52, "updated_at": "2025-04-09T16:16:27.872Z", "reply_count": 1, "reply_to_post_number": 23, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 34, "reads": 155, "readers_count": 154, "score": 369.6, "yours": false, "topic_id": 172246, "topic_slug": "bonus-marks-in-tds-for-jan-25", "display_username": "Akshit Mittal", "primary_group_name": "ds-students", "flair_name": "ds-students", "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": "", "flair_color": "", "flair_group_id": 294, "badges_granted": [], "version": 1, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_see_hidden_post": false, "can_wiki": false, "link_counts": [{"url": "https://forms.gle/DhBW4xdKyv7hXhXD9", "internal": false, "reflection": false, "clicks": 5}], "read": false, "user_title": "", "reply_to_user": {"id": 1, "username": "jkmadathil", "name": "Jayakrishnan", "avatar_template": "/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/jkmadathil/{size}/100121_2.png"}, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [{"id": 2, "count": 11, "can_act": true}, {"id": 6, "can_act": true}, {"id": 3, "can_act": true}, {"id": 4, "can_act": true}, {"id": 8, "can_act": true}, {"id": 10, "can_act": true}, {"id": 7, "can_act": true}], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 21840, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 1, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "post_url": "/t/bonus-marks-in-tds-for-jan-25/172246/27", "user_cakedate": "2023-09-18", "user_birthdate": "1904-05-18", "reactions": [{"id": "heart", "type": "emoji", "count": 11}], "current_user_reaction": null, "reaction_users_count": 11, "current_user_used_main_reaction": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false, "topic_accepted_answer": null}
