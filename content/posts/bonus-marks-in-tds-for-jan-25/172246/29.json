I fully believe this concept and worked together with my group. I created Colab files for 4 GAs for my peers(more than 250 peers must have benefited from it), and <strong>my peers supported me with Project 1 and 2.</strong> <strong>They were mainly responsible for helping me score the full marks in the first two minutes of the ROE</strong> release and we had a meeting after ROE, which was scheduled with you.</p>\n<p>I understand that earning bonus marks for GA7 will be difficult. However, I had no opportunity to participate in this process even after submitting six GAs, while attempting only GA7 (which I understand presents a slim chance) may grant me 5 bonus marks. I acknowledge that the chances are difficult, but many of my peers who didn\u2019t submit GA7, including myself, feel we deserve an opportunity.</p>\n<p>Sir, I am not questioning the grading system but I think it would have been helpful if we had known earlier that peer reviews in GA7 would be part of earning bonus marks. In GA4, Anand Sir made it clear that anyone who asked or answered a question in the GA4 discussion would receive bonus marks but these were specific to GA4 (e.g., a score of 110 out of 100), not the overall grading.</p>\n<p>To be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system. I am not pointing out mistakes, but I just feel the information about the bonus could have been shared more clearly.</p>\n<p>Finally, I want to thank everyone with whom I have connected during this course. I am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible, especially after submitting six GAs, the ROE, and two projects. I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d also like to mention that with the end-term exams just three days away, most of us will be focusing on preparing for them. However, I trust you\u2019ll definitely take our concerns into consideration, and we remain hopeful for clarity regarding the bonus marks.<br>\nThank you once again for your understanding.</p>", "post_number": 29, "post_type": 1, "posts_count": 52, "updated_at": "2025-04-10T03:41:04.049Z", "reply_count": 1, "reply_to_post_number": 28, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 3, "reads": 129, "readers_count": 128, "score": 119.6, "yours": false, "topic_id": 172246, "topic_slug": "bonus-marks-in-tds-for-jan-25", "display_username": "Akshit Mittal", "primary_group_name": "ds-students", "flair_name": "ds-students", "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": "", "flair_color": "", "flair_group_id": 294, "badges_granted": [], "version": 3, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_see_hidden_post": false, "can_wiki": false, "read": false, "user_title": "", "reply_to_user": {"id": 1, "username": "jkmadathil", "name": "Jayakrishnan", "avatar_template": "/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/jkmadathil/{size}/100121_2.png"}, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [{"id": 2, "count": 5, "can_act": true}, {"id": 6, "can_act": true}, {"id": 3, "can_act": true}, {"id": 4, "can_act": true}, {"id": 8, "can_act": true}, {"id": 10, "can_act": true}, {"id": 7, "can_act": true}], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 21840, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 1, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "post_url": "/t/bonus-marks-in-tds-for-jan-25/172246/29", "user_cakedate": "2023-09-18", "user_birthdate": "1904-05-18", "reactions": [{"id": "heart", "type": "emoji", "count": 5}], "current_user_reaction": null, "reaction_users_count": 5, "current_user_used_main_reaction": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false, "topic_accepted_answer": null}
