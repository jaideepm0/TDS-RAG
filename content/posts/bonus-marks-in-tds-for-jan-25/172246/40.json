I completely understand that bonus marks are at the discretion of the course team and are meant to reward diligence and deeper engagement \u2014 which is fair.</p>\n<p>However, I just want to point out a potential nuance: Many of the 192 students who did GA7 may have done so <em>not</em> for extra learning but simply to ensure their top 4 GAs included 4 full scores (e.g., to replace a lower-scoring GA). So the distinction between diligence-for-learning and diligence-for-grade-maximizing becomes blurred.</p>\n<p>Now that bonus marks are announced <em>after</em> the deadline, those who already had 4 perfect scores and skipped GA7 based on the stated structure (top 4 out of 7) are essentially penalized for playing the game by the original rules \u2014 not for a lack of diligence or engagement.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not questioning the bonus system itself, just pointing out that such surprises can unintentionally favor certain strategies over others \u2014 and more transparency around this in future terms might help students make better-informed decisions without second-guessing themselves later.</p>", "post_number": 40, "post_type": 1, "posts_count": 52, "updated_at": "2025-04-11T13:14:20.773Z", "reply_count": 0, "reply_to_post_number": 34, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 0, "reads": 106, "readers_count": 105, "score": 80.2, "yours": false, "topic_id": 172246, "topic_slug": "bonus-marks-in-tds-for-jan-25", "display_username": "Sagandeep Kaur", "primary_group_name": "ds-students", "flair_name": "ds-students", "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": "", "flair_color": "", "flair_group_id": 294, "badges_granted": [], "version": 1, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_see_hidden_post": false, "can_wiki": false, "read": false, "user_title": "", "reply_to_user": {"id": 1, "username": "jkmadathil", "name": "Jayakrishnan", "avatar_template": "/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/jkmadathil/{size}/100121_2.png"}, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [{"id": 2, "count": 4, "can_act": true}, {"id": 6, "can_act": true}, {"id": 3, "can_act": true}, {"id": 4, "can_act": true}, {"id": 8, "can_act": true}, {"id": 10, "can_act": true}, {"id": 7, "can_act": true}], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 22224, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 1, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "post_url": "/t/bonus-marks-in-tds-for-jan-25/172246/40", "user_cakedate": "2023-09-19", "user_birthdate": "1904-12-29", "reactions": [{"id": "heart", "type": "emoji", "count": 4}], "current_user_reaction": null, "reaction_users_count": 4, "current_user_used_main_reaction": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false, "topic_accepted_answer": null}
