I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Here is my response, and I have consulted with the course instructors before sharing this:</p>\n<p>Every term in TDS, both instructors and students are not aware of what bonuses are going to be given out at the start of term. Bonus activities are created at any point, at the discretion of the course team, and the information is not disseminated in a wide fashion. It\u2019s primarily a reward mechanic for those that really are interested in engaging in the whole breadth of the course. For instance, in the last two terms the bonus activities required them to post their solutions in Discourse where the problem statement.</p>\n<p>The course team do not invent GAs for the sake of giving opportunities for scoring marks. They are opportunities to learn and put that learning to use. Another goal is for the GAs to be opportunities to learn by collaborating with each other.</p>\n<p>192 students took that opportunity to engage with GA7. If no one is interested in doing the GA, then why should the team take the effort to create it? Would you rather prefer that we make it mandatory for all students to do all GAs (by making GAA = average of all GA Scores)? Some courses do that. We were very lenient in our GA scoring because the course is tough. Students benefitted from that leniency. Should we reverse our leniency so that everyone \u201cgets the opportunity to get bonus marks?\u201d Think about this</p>\n<p>As a course team, they did not know beforehand that they were going to give opportunities for any bonuses when GA 7 was created. So there was no information to give. Please do understand that the course team do not knowingly hide things from students (that\u2019s a viewpoint that some students seem to suggest with their posts or at least).</p>\n<p>When we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence?</p>\n<p>It is extraordinary that it appears you would prefer if those students, who actually put in the effort, would not be given the opportunity! You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all. They thought it was worth the effort <strong>before</strong> there was any chance of a bonus. And now you begrudge them that reward for their own diligence.</p>\n<p>Once again reiterating this point - Bonus marks are given for activities to students at the discretion of the course team. It always has been. And it has never been widely available to all students in past terms of TDS either. This term is no exception. They are never decided beforehand. They are created as and when there seems to be an appropriate opportunity to reward students for their effort.</p>\n<p>The 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity. But it\u2019s not guaranteed for them either. They have to put in a significant coordinated effort with their peers to actually achieve that. In other words, it\u2019s not a freebie.</p>\n<p>I had promised to provide the distribution of people who did GA7 both in terms of number of assignments done and average score in GAA.
