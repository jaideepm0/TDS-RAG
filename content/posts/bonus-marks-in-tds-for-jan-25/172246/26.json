For ROE and the Week 4 GA, bonus marks were mentioned here on Discourse</p>\n<p>Could you kindly guide me on what exactly we should refer to (such as any email, document, or past policy) and what steps are expected from us to be eligible for the bonus?<br>\nAlso, would students who completed all 5 assignments (but missed GA7) have any alternative way to earn bonus marks through peer reviews or other contributions?</p>\n<p>Apologies if I\u2019ve missed something already mentioned. Your clarification would be really helpful for me and others who are in a similar situation.</p>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/jkmadathil\">@jkmadathil</a> Thank you so much for your time and guidance.</p>\n<p>Warm regards,<br>\n<em>Mishkat Chougule</em></p>", "post_number": 26, "post_type": 1, "posts_count": 52, "updated_at": "2025-04-09T18:03:51.940Z", "reply_count": 0, "reply_to_post_number": 23, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 8, "reads": 156, "readers_count": 155, "score": 144.6, "yours": false, "topic_id": 172246, "topic_slug": "bonus-marks-in-tds-for-jan-25", "display_username": "Mishkat Chougule", "primary_group_name": "ds-students", "flair_name": "ds-students", "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": "", "flair_color": "", "flair_group_id": 294, "badges_granted": [], "version": 2, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_see_hidden_post": false, "can_wiki": false, "read": false, "user_title": null, "reply_to_user": {"id": 1, "username": "jkmadathil", "name": "Jayakrishnan", "avatar_template": "/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/jkmadathil/{size}/100121_2.png"}, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [{"id": 2, "count": 5, "can_act": true}, {"id": 6, "can_act": true}, {"id": 3, "can_act": true}, {"id": 4, "can_act": true}, {"id": 8, "can_act": true}, {"id": 10, "can_act": true}, {"id": 7, "can_act": true}], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 27771, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 1, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "post_url": "/t/bonus-marks-in-tds-for-jan-25/172246/26", "user_cakedate": "2024-02-20", "user_birthdate": "1904-12-02", "reactions": [{"id": "heart", "type": "emoji", "count": 5}], "current_user_reaction": null, "reaction_users_count": 5, "current_user_used_main_reaction": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false, "topic_accepted_answer": null}
