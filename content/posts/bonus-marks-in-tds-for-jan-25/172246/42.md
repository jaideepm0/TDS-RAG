Sir, this sounds reasonably fair. But, what about the students who were lethargic in probably week 1 or week 2, thinking that they can solve the GAs of later weeks? They also get benefitted from this.

I think the attitude of these students is the same as those who skipped GA& as they got 100% GAA within the first five or six weeks
