So they might have done GA7 for the 4 GAA criteria, not just due to diligence. Once again I am not stating that they were all like that, but rather it is a possibility.</p>\n<p>Another issue is that a lot of students might have originally worked hard on earlier assignments to score well but may not have had the time for later assignments such as college students like myself who have end term examinations ongoing currently. Since I saw that I had already put in the effort to do all 6 assignments prior, I only did not do the GA7 since it clashed with my examinations.</p>\n<p>Once again I am not blaming the instructors for this situation sir but the bonus 5 marks can very well change which grade we get in the end, which is the reason why I have created this message. The students who have attempted GA7 do deserve extra marks for their work but if others were informed of the extra 5 marks then we may have also taken part in it, even if we had other prior commitments.</p>\n<p>Thank you once again for reading this message sir and kindly consider our point of view.</p>", "post_number": 45, "post_type": 1, "posts_count": 52, "updated_at": "2025-04-12T12:39:08.444Z", "reply_count": 1, "reply_to_post_number": 34, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 2, "reads": 92, "readers_count": 91, "score": 122.2, "yours": false, "topic_id": 172246, "topic_slug": "bonus-marks-in-tds-for-jan-25", "display_username": "Pranaav", "primary_group_name": "ds-students", "flair_name": "ds-students", "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": "", "flair_color": "", "flair_group_id": 294, "badges_granted": [], "version": 1, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_see_hidden_post": false, "can_wiki": false, "read": false, "user_title": null, "reply_to_user": {"id": 1, "username": "jkmadathil", "name": "Jayakrishnan", "avatar_template": "/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/jkmadathil/{size}/100121_2.png"}, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [{"id": 2, "count": 6, "can_act": true}, {"id": 6, "can_act": true}, {"id": 3, "can_act": true}, {"id": 4, "can_act": true}, {"id": 8, "can_act": true}, {"id": 10, "can_act": true}, {"id": 7, "can_act": true}], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 17135, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 1, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "post_url": "/t/bonus-marks-in-tds-for-jan-25/172246/45", "user_cakedate": "2023-06-02", "reactions": [{"id": "heart", "type": "emoji", "count": 6}], "current_user_reaction": null, "reaction_users_count": 6, "current_user_used_main_reaction": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false, "topic_accepted_answer": null}
