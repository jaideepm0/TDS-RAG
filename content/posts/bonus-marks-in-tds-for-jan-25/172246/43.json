Since many students, including myself, scored well in our best 4 assignments, which were prioritized as we aimed to maximize our grades, we did not attempt GA7.

Conversely, those who struggled initially and attempted GA7 in hopes of improving their grade may benefit more from this bonus. This could inadvertently disadvantage those of us who strategically focused on the highest scoring opportunities available to us.</p>\n<p>Given that the bonus marks were introduced after grades were finalized, I respectfully ask if there\u2019s a possibility to consider an adjustment in these</p>", "post_number": 43, "post_type": 1, "posts_count": 52, "updated_at": "2025-04-11T13:44:52.408Z", "reply_count": 0, "reply_to_post_number": null, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 0, "reads": 112, "readers_count": 111, "score": 66.0, "yours": false, "topic_id": 172246, "topic_slug": "bonus-marks-in-tds-for-jan-25", "display_username": "Naman Gupta", "primary_group_name": "ds-students", "flair_name": "ds-students", "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": "", "flair_color": "", "flair_group_id": 294, "badges_granted": [], "version": 1, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_see_hidden_post": false, "can_wiki": false, "read": false, "user_title": null, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [{"id": 2, "count": 3, "can_act": true}, {"id": 6, "can_act": true}, {"id": 3, "can_act": true}, {"id": 4, "can_act": true}, {"id": 8, "can_act": true}, {"id": 10, "can_act": true}, {"id": 7, "can_act": true}], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 43002, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 1, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "post_url": "/t/bonus-marks-in-tds-for-jan-25/172246/43", "user_cakedate": "2025-01-11", "reactions": [{"id": "heart", "type": "emoji", "count": 3}], "current_user_reaction": null, "reaction_users_count": 3, "current_user_used_main_reaction": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false, "topic_accepted_answer": null}
