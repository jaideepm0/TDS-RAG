Hi team, I am using OpenAI API key for solving Q7 and getting the error like below

```
{'error': {'message': 'You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details. For more information on this error, read the docs: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/error-codes/api-errors.', 'type': 'insufficient_quota', 'param': None, 'code': 'insufficient_quota'}}

```

Is it necessary to pay for the OpenAI API key? Is there any other way?
