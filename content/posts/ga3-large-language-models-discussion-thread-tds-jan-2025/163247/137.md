Hello sir,

While working on this question, I’m encountering this problem. It looks like the request is being made successfully (and I verified it by a POST request via Postman ), however while submitting my URL at the assignment portal, I’m getting an error.

I even tried deploying on a public URL using render. My guess is there is a formatting issue or it’s not sorting correctly based on the similarity score and not returning the top 3.

Would appreciate if I can get some clarity on the same

Thanks and Regards
