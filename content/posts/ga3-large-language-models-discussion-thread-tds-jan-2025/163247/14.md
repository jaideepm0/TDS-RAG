The API key is available at <https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/>

The instructions on how to use the token is given at [GitHub - sanand0/aiproxy: Authorizing proxy for LLMs](https://github.com/sanand0/aiproxy)

You cannot use this token directly with Open AI or any other gpt. These are only valid via the API exposed by the above instructions.

You get a limit of $1. Use with care.

Kind regards
