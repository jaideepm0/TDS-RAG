I tried checking the JSON Output in the Networks tab. I am getting error as “Method Not Found”. But, I have allowed POST Method for question 7 as POST method is used in the question. I also tried checking my API by sending a POST request by the same parameters as given by the Website. I am getting the proper response when I give an API request. Can you please help me out here? I have attached the screenshot of the error as Picture -1 and the correct output what I get as Picture-2. Please help me out as I am facing issue for all the API Questions though I am getting the right output. Thank You.
