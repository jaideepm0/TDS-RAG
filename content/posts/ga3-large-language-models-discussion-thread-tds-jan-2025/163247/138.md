Hello, I think the format of the response body should be like: { “matches” : [ “ABC”, “ABC”, “ABC”]}. I think it is because of your formatting issue.

I had used (well gpt) the below two decorators to format:

```
class SearchRequest(BaseModel):
    docs: List[str]  # The list of documents to search through
    query: str       # The search query string

class SearchResponse(BaseModel):
    matches: List[str]  # The list of matched documents

.........

@app.post("/similarity", response_model=SearchResponse)


.........

return SearchResponse(matches=sorted_matches[:3])

```

It basically checks the Request and Response formatting. This worked for me. Hope it helps. And thanks btw for mentioning using POSTMAN, as I had never used it before, so it clicked in my mind after reading your post only that I can basically debug using POSTMAN. Thank you for that ![:grinning:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/grinning.png?v=12 ":grinning:")
