Hi Team,  
I have attended the Graded Assignment for Tools in Data Science for the week 4 and the saved scores says i have got 2 marks. ( TDS 2025 Jan GA4 - Data Sourcing).  
But in the evaluation it says i have not submitted the GA4 from this course. Can you please clarify the same.

Attached the screenshots for both
