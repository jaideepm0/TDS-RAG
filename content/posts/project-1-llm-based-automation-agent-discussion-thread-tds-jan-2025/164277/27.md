> Regarding Wednenday 9-10 pm live session, maybe the instructors could also discuss how to use docker as a virtual environmen

In Tuesday’s(21 January) session we had discussed docker towards ending of session.  
What was discussed in that live session regarding docker:

1. Search for existing containers on repositories such as dockerhub.
2. Pull an existing docker image.
3. Run that image inside a container.
4. Enter to that container and modify something(such as installing python inside a ubuntu container, for customization or create some file)
5. Once done you can commit it.
6. And push customized container’s image to docker hub.

Regarding local models running for project1, it’s a good idea, we will see if it’s possible to discuss in session.
