To test that my application would run everywhere, I first deleted all images from my local machine using <code>podman rmi -a</code> and then ran <code>podman run --rm -p 8000:8000 -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN $IMAGE_NAME</code> with the appropriate variables set. This is as per the instructions provided <a href=\"https://github.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tree/tds-2025-01-project-1-wip/project-1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here</a>. But this gave me the following error:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">Error: short-name \"freshbash/dataworks-agent\" did not resolve to an alias and no unqualified-search registries are defined in \"/etc/containers/registries.conf\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above is the format in which we have to provide the image name in the Google form. So, I was confused whether this would succeed during actual evaluation.</p>\n<p>The only way its working right now is when I specify the image name to be <code>docker.io/freshbash/dataworks-agent</code></p>\n<p>I\u2019m not yet very good with how containers work so some insights would be very helpful.
