If you are using the function calling approach, you could just parse the ‘#’ and change it to ‘number’ and then send the prompt to the llm for that particular task.

Or another approach is tell the llm,

If you ever see the phrase ‘count the # of’ in a task, please interpret it as ‘count the number of’. For example  
Count the # of Fridays means  
Count the number of Fridays
