you have to give the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` to the evaluate.py by either  
bash - `export AIPROXY_TOKEN="your token"`  
or  
powershell - `$env:AIPROXY_TOKEN="your token"`  
the evaluate.py file takes the token to send request to embedding end point for processing.  
so you have to set `AIPROXY_TOKEN` in both terminals  
i.e. app.py and evaluate.py teminals
