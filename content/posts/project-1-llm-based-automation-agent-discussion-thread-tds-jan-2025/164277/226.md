I am also facing the same issue.  
Evaluation Output:

```
HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized"

üî¥ A9 failed: 'data'

‚ùå A9 FAILED

```

I sense ‚ÄòAuthentication Problem‚Äô happens only with the evaluation script, as the curl requests seems to work fine.

```

```

Any views? [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)
