1. Previously I asked for some more credits to test my project. I got an email stating I have been provided with a new token but I think I got that same token again, not a new one. I still cant send request to the AIPROXY. Please help.
2. Do I need to submit the docker image name with the tag or without the tag? I submitted it before without the tag. Now i see that I have tagged the image with as v1 but I cant submit the form due to pattern matching problems. Should i submit again after tagging it with :latest ?
