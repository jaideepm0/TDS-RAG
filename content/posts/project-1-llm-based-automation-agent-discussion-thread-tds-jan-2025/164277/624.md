I have received a mail that my project has ""No “MIT” in LICENSE;No Dockerfile " which I saw today. My project has MIT licence and Dockerfile was also there… but to reconfirm I pulled my dockerfile from dockerhub to github only . NOw am not sure will that be considered now in my project submission or not. Requesting to kindly consider current state of my project in submission for my project.
