Respected [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton) and [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) ,

Is anyone actively monitoring the Discourse page? I have been raising this issue for the past few days, but there has been no response. Does this mean the TAs are not addressing studentsâ€™ concerns?

I am encountering the following error while running my project with these LLM endpoints:

* **<https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions>**
* **<https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings>**

  This issue is blocking my progress, and I urgently need assistance to resolve it. Kindly provide guidance or suggest a solution at the earliest.

Looking forward to your response.

Thanks,  
Telvin Varghese
