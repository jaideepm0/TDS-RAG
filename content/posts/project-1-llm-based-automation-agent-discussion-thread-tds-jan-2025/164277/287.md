sir i have tried to solve the A1. when I want to check the solution we are asked for the datagen module as the evaluate.py have  
’

```
''from datagen import (
    get_markdown,
    get_dates,
    get_contacts,
    get_logs,
    get_docs,
    get_email,
    get_credit_card,
    get_comments,
    get_tickets,
)
'''

```

so do we need to download the datagen.py in the local system first…

Or it should be the part of the automation only…
