Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Facing some issues in running my project. Taking an example of the Phase A - A3 task.

I am able to read my files through the GET/read/data/dates.txt query.  
I am also able to use the count\_wednesdays function through the POST/run task/count\_wednesdays.

But when I am entering a query such as “count\_wednesdays in data/dates.txt” I am unable to get a response.

Please advice. Thank you.
