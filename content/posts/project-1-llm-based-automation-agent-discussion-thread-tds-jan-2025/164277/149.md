Dear Instructors ([@carlton](/u/carlton), [@iamprasna](/u/iamprasna)):

Confirming, just to be needfully pedantic:

It will **solely** be the responsibility of the Project Evaluator (human or machine) to parse the correct `AIPROXY_TOKEN` generated against my IITM email ID (presumably, per some database which holds all such generated `AIPROXY_TOKEN`s of the students who have generated one); and the correct `$IMAGE_NAME` (to-be-submitted by myself in the Project Submission Google Form) in `podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000`, correct?

Asking this seemingly obvious question, as (apparently) the actual `AIPROXY_TOKEN` is not to be included anywhere in the code, or the repository, or the dockerfile.
