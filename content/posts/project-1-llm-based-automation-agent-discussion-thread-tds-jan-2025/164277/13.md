While implementing task A5, I am confused about what recent actually means in the phrase “recent log file”, mentioned under task A5, in the problem statement. This confusion arises because there are no dates corresponding to the log files. Should I consider log-0 as the most recent one? or the log-<largest\_number> file? Please clarify.
