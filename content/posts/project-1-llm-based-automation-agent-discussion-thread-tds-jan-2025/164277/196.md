After submitting docker image through, it will be pulled and our token will be used.

Things to be checked at your end.  
1. `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME` works fine  
2. Above command will start 8000 server so use evaluate.py to test if things are working as expected.

Kind regards.
