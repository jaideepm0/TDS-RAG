On my system evaulate.py is throwing an error on A2 trying to execute npx on format.md before the llm is even invoked. However running the command directly on the command line works.

evaluate.py:  
![:red_circle:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/red_circle.png?v=12 ":red_circle:") A2 failed: Command ‘[‘npx’, ‘prettier@3.4.2’, ‘–stdin-filepath’, ‘data/format.md’]’ returned non-zero exit status 2.

![:x:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/x.png?v=12 ":x:") A2 FAILED

bash:  
npx prettier@3.4.2 --stdin-filepath data/format.md

bash works as expected. Can someone help?
