Hence executing code Interpreter tools failed as the model gave outdated code. I have raised this issue before</p>\n<p>Hence i moved to function calling, using local llms as cost-effective solution and it was quite robust.</p>\n<p>I just need to understand how the function should be general, maybe 2-3 tasks you could provide the general description along with all the ways one would query the agent llm(ie our project).
