But the data gets downloaded to C drive instead of the project folder  
The datagen.py file is in the project folder itself.

am I making any error when setting the directories?

Please help, have been facing this issue since the beginning of this project, initially tried to move the files from C drive to project folder but that does not seem like a viable solution.
