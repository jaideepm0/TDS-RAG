Hey [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) , I actually submitted the project already in the morning,  
I included all the deliverables and things mentioned in the evaluation section.

But since I was actively testing with the - `datagen.py` and `evaluate.py`, I forgot to remove them before submission.

However these files do not play a role in my project execution in any way, they just sit idle. Will there be any issue?
