Hello everyone, [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton)  
I had a few queries regarding the project;

1. I am preloading my docker image with uv and generating the /data files when the container is ran. For task A1, I am automating my server to remove the /data directory that’s already present and run datagen.py again. Is this fine?
2. For /read endpoint, is there a standard for parameters like “path=/data/format.md” or the parameter could be a plain english sentence like “path=show the data in format.md”?
3. Are we concerned about what’s shown on the console if I run a /run command as long as it gets the job done?
4. For tasks A1-10, are the file paths provided in the project doc standard or even they’re flexible? Ex. “Count the number of Wednesdays in file /data/format.md, and write just the number to /data/out.txt”
