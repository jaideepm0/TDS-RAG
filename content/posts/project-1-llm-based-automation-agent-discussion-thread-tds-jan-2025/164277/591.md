Dear [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) , [@carlton](/u/carlton) , [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) , and [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)

Thank you all for this wonderful project. Coming from a non-coding background, I have learned a lot new things throughout this project building process.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir, yesterday’s session provided valuable insights into Method 1 (prompt engineering) for dynamically handling tasks. I was able to develop an application using this approach; however, due to submission time constraints, I could not verify all tasks (my bad). While I tested some tasks and found the results to be highly accurate, I was unable to validate everything thoroughly.  
Therefore, I submitted the function-calling approach (Method 2) instead.

I sincerely appreciate everyone’s guidance and support.
