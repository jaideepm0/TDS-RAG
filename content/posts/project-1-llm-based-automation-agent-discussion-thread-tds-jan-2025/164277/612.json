An unfortunate mistake on my part has led to the upload of an incorrect Docker image link. When I checked the authenticity of the link, it showed an error, even though the GitHub repository link is functioning perfectly.</p>\n<p>I have poured my heart and soul into this project, dedicating countless hours and sleepless nights to ensure its success. The project has successfully passed both Test A and Test B, and I was thrilled to see my hard work paying off. However, this single error has left me devastated.</p>\n<p>I am pleading with you, with all my heart, to allow me to correct this mistake by updating the Docker image link. Alternatively, I humbly request that my application be reviewed directly through GitHub. Please consider this an exception, as I have worked tirelessly over the past two weeks to create an application that is 890 lines long.</p>\n<p>I beg for your understanding and leniency in this matter. This project means the world to me, and I am genuinely sobbing over this setback.</p>\n<p>Thank you for considering my heartfelt request.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Rishit Jain<br>\n(24F2004595)</p>", "post_number": 612, "post_type": 1, "posts_count": 614, "updated_at": "2025-02-16T18:51:43.271Z", "reply_count": 2, "reply_to_post_number": 343, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 0, "reads": 129, "readers_count": 128, "score": 50.6, "yours": false, "topic_id": 164277, "topic_slug": "project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025", "display_username": "Rishit", "primary_group_name": "ds-students", "flair_name": "ds-students", "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": "", "flair_color": "", "flair_group_id": 294, "badges_granted": [], "version": 1, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_see_hidden_post": false, "can_wiki": false, "read": true, "user_title": null, "reply_to_user": {"id": 9419, "username": "s.anand", "name": "Anand S", "avatar_template": "/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/s.anand/{size}/15264_2.png"}, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [{"id": 2, "count": 1, "can_act": true}, {"id": 6, "can_act": true}, {"id": 3, "can_act": true}, {"id": 4, "can_act": true}, {"id": 8, "can_act": true}, {"id": 10, "can_act": true}, {"id": 7, "can_act": true}], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 35818, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 1, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "post_url": "/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/612", "user_cakedate": "2024-09-21", "user_birthdate": "1904-02-20", "reactions": [{"id": "heart", "type": "emoji", "count": 1}], "current_user_reaction": null, "reaction_users_count": 1, "current_user_used_main_reaction": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false, "topic_accepted_answer": null}
