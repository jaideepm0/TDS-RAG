Please read the documentation carefully from top to bottom.

So the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test.
