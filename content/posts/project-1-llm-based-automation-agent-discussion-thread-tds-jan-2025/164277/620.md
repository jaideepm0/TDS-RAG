[@s.anand](/u/s.anand)  
[@carlton](/u/carlton) sorry to disturb you, project1 deadline is over.  
I made a mistake in my project. In my call llm function i set some payload instead of default for open ai api call like max token, temp. , n, stop etc.  
Due to this, some tasks may fail especially credit card image task will fail 100%, if possible can i just remove that payload from git hub repository . or you can check this call llm function present in my task\_handler.py file of my repository.  
I found this issue after deadline. If possible consider this request. I never engaged in a project or course like for this one. I love this project genuinely.

my github repo : [GitHub - 21f3001076/TDS\_Project\_1: This is IITM Data Science TDS Course Project 1 Repository](https://github.com/21f3001076/TDS_Project_1)  
Thankyou
