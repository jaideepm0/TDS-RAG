Command to run the image in the docs, seemed to have some error,

The command:  
`podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000`

gives the error:  
`crun: executable file `-e` not found in $PATH: No such file or directory: OCI runtime attempted to invoke a command that was not found`

However the correct command seems to be:  
`podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN="$AIPROXY_TOKEN" -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`

This works totally fine.
