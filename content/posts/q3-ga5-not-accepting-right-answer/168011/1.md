It seems that the question in *Graded Assignment 5 for TDS* is producing incorrect results despite the same logic working correctly for other variations of the problem. Please check into this question once as I have cross checked with many of the students and chatgpt and all of us faced this issue in this question. Thanks!

code to take reference from:

```
import gzip
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

log_path = 's-anand.net-May-2024.gz'
start_time = datetime.strptime('01:00:00', '%H:%M:%S').time()
end_time = datetime.strptime('15:00:00', '%H:%M:%S').time()
log_data = []

def parse_log(line):
    parts = line.split(' ')
    log_time = datetime.strptime(parts[3][1:], '%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S')
    method, url, status = parts[5][1:], parts[6], int(parts[8])
    return log_time, method, url, status

with gzip.open(log_path, 'rt') as file:
    for entry in file:
        log_time, method, url, status = parse_log(entry)
        if method == 'GET' and url.startswith('/blog/') and 200 <= status < 300:
            if log_time.weekday() == 0 and start_time <= log_time.time() < end_time:
                log_data.append(entry)

print(f"Successful GET requests: {len(log_data)}")

```

ps: I shared code after the deadline hopefully no issues there! ![:laughing:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/laughing.png?v=12 ":laughing:")
