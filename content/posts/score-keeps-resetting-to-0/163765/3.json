In my last submission the score was 7.25. Right now it is showing 0. The problem is i had few questions remaining to solve and i dont know which ones now. All of them r showing empty in the solution box. Also i didnt write my answers someplace else, so i would have to solve all the questions again? And also if i just for example for testing submit solution of 1 question now then my score would get reduced from 7.25 to the marks of that 1 question i submitted right?</p>", "post_number": 3, "post_type": 1, "posts_count": 6, "updated_at": "2025-01-18T05:02:22.594Z", "reply_count": 0, "reply_to_post_number": 2, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 0, "reads": 43, "readers_count": 42, "score": 7.6, "yours": false, "topic_id": 163765, "topic_slug": "score-keeps-resetting-to-0", "display_username": "Gaurav Ghodge", "primary_group_name": "ds-students", "flair_name": "ds-students", "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": "", "flair_color": "", "flair_group_id": 294, "badges_granted": [], "version": 1, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_see_hidden_post": false, "can_wiki": false, "read": false, "user_title": "", "reply_to_user": {"id": 16094, "username": "carlton", "name": "Carlton D'Silva", "avatar_template": "/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/carlton/{size}/56317_2.png"}, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [{"id": 2, "can_act": true}, {"id": 6, "can_act": true}, {"id": 3, "can_act": true}, {"id": 4, "can_act": true}, {"id": 8, "can_act": true}, {"id": 10, "can_act": true}, {"id": 7, "can_act": true}], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 12639, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 1, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "post_url": "/t/score-keeps-resetting-to-0/163765/3", "user_cakedate": "2022-05-01", "reactions": [], "current_user_reaction": null, "reaction_users_count": 0, "current_user_used_main_reaction": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false, "topic_accepted_answer": null}
