Hi, I asked this doubt on discourse but couldn’t get clear answer. I have completed the project(testing included) and will be hosting it locally. Will the course team inform us before performing actual evaluation? I will be really busy for the next 2 weeks and it is also possible that my machine may not be with me.  So a heads up will be really appreciated.  Also it would be great if evaluation is completed at the earliest.  Thanks.
